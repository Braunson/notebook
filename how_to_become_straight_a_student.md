How to Become a Straight-A Student
==================================

Cal Newport writes a concise guide on how to become a straight-A student.  He
interviewed many students from different colleges/majors and filtered out the
"crammers".  His tips are for studying smarter as opposed to working harder.

At the end of each part, he provides a cheat sheet.  These notes are based on
those cheat sheets.

Study Basics
============

Manage your time in five minutes a day:

* jot down todos/deadlines on a list whenever they arise
* transfer your list to a calendar every morning
* plan your day each morning by labeling todos with realistic time frames
* move what you don't have time for to different dates

Declare war on procrastination:

* keep a progress journal, record what you accomplished and what you failed to
  do and why
* eat healthy snacks to maximize energy
* transform horrible tasks into a big event to help you start (brag to people
  that you're going off to some lonely place to study!)
* build work routines to make steady progress
* schedule "hard days" in advance to minimize impact (hard days are full days
  where you do work, avoid working nights!)

Choose when, where, and how long:

* fit as much work as possible in mornings and afternoon, between classes and
  obligations (don't work evenings or nights!)
* determine how long you will study for before starting
* study in isolated locations
* take a break every hour

Quizzes and Exams
=================

Take smart notes:

* always go to class and try to take best notes possible
* for nontechnical courses, capture big ideas in question/evidence/conclusion
  format
* for technical courses, record as many problem sets as possible
* if you don't understand something, mark it with a question mark and come back
  as soon as possible

The **question/evidence/conclusion** format is important.  Often times, they
appear out of order in lectures.  Feel free to leave them blank and come back
to it later on.  Do these for reading assignments, too.

Demote your assignments:

* work a little bit each day on assignments or problem sets
* read only the favored sources in the syllabus in detail, not the extra sources
* the importance hierarchy is: readings that make an argument go first, then
  readings that describe an event/person, finally readings that provide context
* take reading notes in the same question/evidence/conclusion format
* work in groups for problem sets (try them before going to groups or getting
  help from TAs)
* write up your answers to problem sets formally the first time around

Marshal your resources:

* figure out exactly what the test will cover
* cluster notes for nontechnical courses (lectures + readings)
* build mega problem sets for technical courses
* annotate each problem set with a "big question overview" - these are usually
  general questions like "what are the steps to solve these general types of
  problems?"
* get practice exams or previous exams offered

Conquer the material:

* use the quiz-and-recall method
* don't do everything in your head - write it out or say it out loud
* spread out required rote memorization tasks

Invest in "academic disaster insurance" by answering any of your question marks
from reading or lectures.

Provide "A+" answers:

* look over the whole test first to get a feel on how long it will take and
  where the easy questions are
* figure out how much time to spend on each question
* answer questions in order of increasing difficulty
* write out mini-outline before tackling essay questions
* use all leftover time to re-check answers

Essays and Papers
=================

Start looking for an interesting topic early.  **START EARLY!!!**

Conduct a thesis hunting expedition.  Start with general sources and then follow
references to find more targeted sources.  Narrow it down.

Seek a second opinion for your thesis.  Have it approved by the professor before
anything else.

Research like a machine:

* find sources
* make personal copies of all sources
* annotate the material
* decide if you're done, if not, repeat steps

Craft a powerful story:

* develop a well-balanced, easy-to-follow argument
* dedicate a good deal of thought over time to get it right
* describe argument in a topic-level outline
* type supporting quotes directly into your outline

Consult your expert panel:

* before writing, get opinions on the organization of your argument/outline
* professors and TAs can also be consulted
* the larger the % of your grade, the more people to consult

Write without agony:

* start filling in your outline
* articulate points clearly, re-edit small portions as necessary
* write no more than 3-5 pages per day (5-8 per weekend)

Fix, don't fixate.  Solid editing requires three passes:

* argument adjustment pass: read to make sure your argument is clear and fix
  obvious errors and rewrite where the flow needs improvement
* out loud pass: read it out loud, mark any awkward or unclear passages
* sanity pass: final pass over to check overall flow and any remaining errors

See "On Writing Well" notes, you may want to do a simplification pass.
