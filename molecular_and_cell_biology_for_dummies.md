Molecular and Cell Biology for Dummies
======================================

Rene Fester Kratz, PhD, teaches us microbiology without using jargon.  This
book was intended to help 2 audiences: students and self-learners.  It's
organized into 7 parts: intro to the cell, molecules, working cell, genetics,
molecular genetics, tools of molecular biology, and "part of tens".

Exploring the World of the Cell
===============================

Molecular/cellular biology is the study of cell structure/function down to the
individual molecules that make it up.  This chapter is an overview of the book.
Everything will be explained in greater detail in later chapters.

Cells are the smallest unit of life.  All living things are made up of cells,
including us.  Besides the cells that make us up, there are also prokaryotic
cells:

* Bacteria - they make us sick but do good things too
* Archaea - just as common but less known, recently discovered

Viruses are not cells.  They're smaller than bacteria and our eukaryotic cells.
They attack other cells and are parasitic.  Attacked cells may end up reproducing
more viruses.  Viruses are the cause of sore throats and HIV.

Cells require a lot of the same things we need:

* eating food or taking in a source of energy for cellular metabolism
* breathing oxygen or cellular respiration for energy
* using food/energy to grow and reproduce

You started life as a single cell, a combination of a sperm/egg.  Each of these
germ cells donated half of your genetic information (23 chromosomes each).

The instructions for each cell to work is encoded in DNA.  Every cell has a copy
of your DNA.  They're constantly reading it to build new molecules like proteins.
Proteins are created via transcription and translation.  Signals, like hormones,
can tell cells to change behavior.  Gene regulation allows cells to turn off
some genes and turn others on.

New technologies have been discovered which allow scientists to extract, read,
or modify DNA.  New branches of biology are opening up: 

* Bioinformatics - blending computing, biology, and IT to organize/analyze large
  amounts of biological information
* Genomics - study of entire genomes of organisms to learn/discover new proteins
  and genes
* Proteomics - study of proteins for different cells

Take a Tour Inside the Cell
===========================

All cells fall in one of three groups:

* Eucarya: plants, animals, fungi, and protists
* Bacteria: single-celled microorganisms
* Archaea: single-celled similar to bacteria

Cells of Eucarya are called **eukaryotic**.  They have a nucleus containing DNA
and organelles.  Bacteria/archaea cells are **prokaryotic**.  They don't have
a nucleus, their DNA floats within the cytoplasm.  They're typically smaller.

All living things are made up of cells.  Some are multicelluar - body is made
up of multiple cells.  Others are unicellular.

All cells contain:

* Plasma Membrane or Cytoplasmic Membrane - the boundary of a cell
* Cytoplasm - area inside cell
* DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid - plans for how cell is built and how it functions
* Ribosomes - structures where protein is built

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and have proteins on it.  The
proteins consist of receptors, which detect signals in the cell's environment,
and transport proteins.

The cytoplasm is crowded.  Most of the metabolism of a cell occurs here,
including the production of proteins.  The organelles move around in here.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is separated from the cytoplasm via the nucleus.  For
prokaryotic cells, DNA is in the cytoplasm area called nucleoid.

Ribosomes are the workbenches where proteins are made.  They're made up of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins.

The nucleus contains the cell's DNA, which is the instructions for the cell.
The boundary is called a nuclear envelope.  DNA is in the form of chromosomes
or chromatin (wounded up vs unwounded spaghetti-ish).  The cell reads the DNA
and builds ribosomal subunits in the nucleoli area of the nucleus and then
ships it out to the cytoplasm.

Molecules enter in/leave the nucleus via nuclear pores.  This includes:

* RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits
* proteins
* nucleotides - building blocks of DNA and RNA

The endomembrane system is the post office of the cell - it builds proteins and
lipids then ships them off.  There are a few components:

The endoplasmic reticulum is a component that starts at the nucleus and comes in
two types: rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  The
rough one has attached ribosomes used to deliver protein to a special
destination.

The Golgi apparatus will tag proteins before shipping them off.  The middle of
the ER is called a lumen.

Vesicles transport things around the cells.  Transport vesicles carry molecules,
lysosomes dispose of garbage, secretory vesicles bring materials to the plasma
membrane.

Peroxisomes help break down lipids.  This ends the endomembrane system...

The mitochondrion is the fireplace where cells burn their food via cellular
respiration.  Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell which transfer
energy from food to ATP (stored energy for the cell).

Chloroplasts make food molecules via photosynthesis and are only found in plant
cells.

The structure of the cell is supported by the cytoskeleton - kind of a scaffold
which holds the cell together.  They run though the cell providing a network
for vesicles/organelles to travel.  Cells flick with cilia and eukaryotic
flagella to move about.  Cytoskeletal proteins come in three groups:

* Microfilaments - make muscle cells contract and act as railroad tracks to
  a cell's organelles
* Microtubules - protein inside cilia and flagella
* Intermediate Filaments - reinforcing proteins for cells

The plasma membrane provides a selective boundary for the cell.  Most cells have
additional layers outside of it.  The layer around the animal cell is called the
extracellular matrix.

Dead or Alive: Viruses
======================

**Viruses** are microscopic particles of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and protein
that attack cells and turn them into virus factories.  They're responsible for
significant diseases: measles, influenza, polio, and AIDS.

Whereas bacteria are living cells, viruses are not.  They cannot do anything 
without hijacking a cell.  Scientists don't consider viruses to be alive.

The simplest viruses have two components: a **nucleic acid core** and a
**protein capsid**.  The DNA or RNA contains instructions for taking over cells
to produce more virions (viral particles) and the capsid is an outer shell.

Some viruses also have an outer envelope that they steal from the cell's
membrane.  They might also have proteins that stick out called **spikes**, which
help attach them to cells.

Viruses come in three shapes:

* helical - form of twisting helix around nucleic acid core
* polyhedral - regular geometric shape
* complex - separate patches of protein forming unique structures

Viruses attach to cells if they have the right viral protein that's accepted
by the cell's receptors.  They then dig a hole through the cell wall, slip in
by fusing with the cell membrane, or trick the cell into bringing it inside.
**Host range** is used to denote the type of cells a virus can infect.

**Bacteriophage** (phage = eat, so bacteria eater) are a type of virus which
attack bacteria.  In the lytic cycle, bacteriophage will use the cell to create
more phage and destroy it.  In the lysogenic cycle, bacteriophage will
enter during a dormant stage.  The host cell will reproduce - creating cells
which are infected.

Example steps of the lytic cycle:

1. Attachment - proteins of virus attach to receptors of bacteria
2. Penetration - genetic material of virus enters
3. Biosynthesis - virus uses host cell's nucleotides/amino acids to make more
   viral parts.  ATP from host cell supplies energy
4. Maturation - viral particles assemble into new virus
5. Release - virus leaves host cell, lysing or destroying as they leave

Bacteriophage that enter the lysogenic cycle remain inactive/dormant in the
bacteria for a while.  During this time, their DNA is integrated with the host
cell's DNA (now called **prophage**).  The steps are then: attachment,
penetration, recombination, replication.  Environmental signals will trigger
the virus to go into lytic cycle.

Viruses that attack eukaryotic cells are the same, but some terms are different:

* Latent instead of lysogenic
* Provirus instead of prophage
* Acute disease instead of lytic cycle

After an enveloped virus attaches to its eukaryotic host cell, it enters via
one of two ways:

* Fusion - envelope of virus  fuses with host cell's membrane, like two soap
  bubbles merging together
* Receptor-mediated endocytosis - the host cell is tricked, wraps the virus in
  a vesicle and brings it in

After entering, the virus removes its capsid (called **uncoating**) and releases
its genetic material into the host cell.  Viruses have different reproductive
strategies which are dependent on the class of virus:

* Double-stranded DNA viruses: ie smallpox, inserts its genetic material into
  the host's nucleus.  It gets copied whenever the host divides
* Retroviruses: ie HIV, single stranded RNA enters the host cell and reverse
  transcribes a double stranded DNA to insert into the nucleus
* Double-stranded RNA viruses: introduces their RNA into the cytoplasm to make
  viral proteins
* Single-stranded RNA viruses: negative-sense or positive-sense.  Negative like
  influenza, insert their RNA into cytoplasm to create new RNA and make proteins.
  Positive insert their RNA directly, doesn't need to create new RNA.

Viruses may use their own enzymes or host enzymes to copy genetic material.
Viral enzymes make more mistakes in host enzymes, causing mutations in viruses.
The variation makes it harder to defeat.

After the genetic material is copied, the viruses leave the host cell.  Sometimes
they leave via **budding**, pushing up against the membrane and taking a chunk of
it while leaving.  This helps disguise them as cells.

Putting it all together, the steps are: attachment, penetration, uncoating,
biosynthesis, maturation, release.

# Better Living Through Chemistry

Organisms are made of cells.  Cells are made of molecules.  Molecules are made
of atoms.  Atoms are made of subatomic particles.

Subatomic particles are protons (positive charge), electrons (negative charge),
and neutrons (no charge).  The nucleus of an atom is made of protons/neutrons
and the electrons orbit it.  The number of protons determine what element an
atom is.  It's called the **atomic number**.

An **isotope** has different numbers of neutrons than protons.  Carbon usually
has 6 protons/neutrons.  Carbon-5 is an isotope variation that has 5 neutrons.

Periodic tables often include the **atomic mass** of elements, which is the
average mass in atomic mass units of all atoms on earth for each element.  It's
the number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

Atoms form larger structures called **molecules** via chemical bonds.  This
will happen via:

1. Atoms share an electron to form a more stable structure
2. There is an attraction between opposite electrical charges

Each element has an electron configuration, which is useful in determining how
stable that element is.  Noble gases have an outer shell full of electrons, so
they're pretty stable.  **Valence electrons** are the electrons in the outermost
energy levels.  They're the electrons which are usually given/shared.

The **Periodic Table** will tell you how many valence electrons an element has.
Most atoms follow the octet rule, most of them want 8 electrons in its outer
shell.  Elements on the left side tend to want to give away electrons.  Elements
on the right side really want more electrons.  The tendency for an atom to
attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.

If one atom takes an electron, an **oxidation reduction reaction** or 
**redox reaction** has occurred.  The atom giving up an electron was **oxidized**
and the atom gaining an electron was **reduced** (think in term of charges).

For more information on electron configuration and chemical bonds, see notes on
Khan Academy's Chemistry lectures.

Whereas an isotope had differing numbers of neutrons, **ions** have different
number of electrons causing a charge.  **Ionic bonds** form due to electrical
attractions from opposite charges.  They're strong in solid form, but weak in
liquid form and in water.

**Covalent bonds** occur when atoms share an electron.  Two oxygen elements are
equally electronegative and they both benefit by sharing two electrons by
becoming more stable (rule of eights).

In a **polar covalent bond**, the electron spends more time orbiting the nucleus
of the more electronegative atom.  After polar covalent bonds form, they setup
the formation of **hydrogen bonds**.  Hydrogen bonds are weak electrical forces
between opposite ends of polar bonds.  They're like velcro.  Hydrogen bonds
hold the two helixes of your DNA together.

**Hydrophobic molecules** don't mix well with water.  Water has many polar and
hydrogen bonds.  When a molecule with polar bond is mixed in, it dissolves well.
When a covalent bonded molecule is mixed in, it's rejected - like water/oil.

Your body is 60-75% water.  Water is essential to living things:

* Water is a solvent.  Ions and polar molecules dissolve in water.  Water
  prevents them from forming solids.  All chemical reactions in cells occur
  in water.
* Water helps moves things across membranes.
* Water causes hydrophobic interactions.
* Water helps maintain the structure of important molecules.

Water molecules reach a equilibrium where H(2)O splits and forms hydrogen and
hydroxide ion:

    H(2)O <--> H^+ + OH^-

The concentration of hydrogen ions is measured in pH (-log of the molarity).
The concentration of hydroxide ions is measured in pOH.  A pH of 7 is neutral
on the acid/base scale.

Cells can only survive within a narrow range of pH - they prefer neutral.  Some
chemicals can add hydrogen ions and increase the pH of water.  These are acids.
Chemicals that remove hydrogen ions are bases.

Cells employ **buffers** to maintain the pH of water.  These buffers can release
hydrogen ions in a solution or remove them.  Your blood has the acid/base pair
of carbonic acid and bicarbonate to maintain your blood pH.

Cells often recycle and rebuild structures using existing molecules.  When a
structure is no longer needed, cells will break it apart to form a new one from
the pieces (different shape and recombining with different atoms).

There are four groups of macromolecules (big molecules) important to the cell:
carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.  All of them but lipids are
made up of the same repeating type of building block.  A long repetitive molecule
is called a **polymer**.  The building block of a polymer is a **monomer**.

Whenever a monomer is added to the polymer, a water molecules formed.  The
reaction is called **condensation or dehydration synthesis**.  Polymers can be
broken down into individual monomers via **hydrolysis** - a water molecule is 
inserted into the bond between two monomers to break it apart.

Remember hydro means water and lysis means breaking (as in when a virus lyces
from the cell - breaks out of).

Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are
=================================

Carbohydrates are made of carbons, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio of:

    CH(2)O

They're divided into two groups: monosaccharides and polysaccharides.  They're
also known as simple sugars and complex carbohydrates.

Monosaccharides have a backbone of 3-7 carbons and are called trioses, tetroses,
pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses.  They have Hydroxyl groups (OH) attached to
every carbon but one which make up sugars polar (and dissolves in water).

They have one double-bonded oxygen attached to the carbon backbone called a
carbonyl group.  If it's at the end, the sugar is an aldose.  If it's within
the backbone, it's a ketose.  It's not just the number of atoms which determine
what kind of simple sugar it is - the structure is important too.

Polysaccharides are multiple monosaccharides joined together by condensation
reactions (removal of water).  The bonds between them are glycosidic linkages.
They're classified by how many monosaccharides there are: disaccharides like
lactose, oligosaccharides (short chains), or polysaccharides (long chains).

Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for cells.  They provide
structural molecules for cells like the walls.  Cells are marked with
glycoproteins (proteins with sugar) to identify them.  They make a sticky matrix
around cells to help bacteria stick.

Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
=========================================

Most jobs in the cell are done by proteins.  The shape of a protein is essential
for its job.  They control metabolism, transport, communication, structure, 
division, and more.  They can specifically target a particular molecule or
process.

Proteins start as polymers of **amino acids**, also called a **polypeptide**.
Once that folds and becomes functional, it's a protein.  Some protein are made
of multiple polypeptides.

If a protein **denatures** (unfolds), it can no longer function.  Protein
structure or **conformation** is organized into 4 categories:

* Primary structure - sequence of amino acids
* Secondary structure - small areas folded into alpha helices and pleated sheets
* Tertiary structure - final 3D shape of one folded amino acid chain
* Quarternary structure - found in proteins consisting multiple folded chains

The cell contains 20 variants of amino acids.  The choice and ordering of these
amino acids makes up the primary structure of a protein.  Each amino acid has 
the same structure, a central carbon atom is bonded to 4 different chemicals:

* a nitrogen-containing amino group (-NH(2) or NH(3)+)
* a carboxyl group (-COOH or -COO-)
* a hydrogen atom (-H)
* A side chain (-R) that varies between the 20 amino acids

The N-C-C backbone pattern is useful in identifying amino acids.  You can use
it to distinguish proteins/carbohydrates.  The bonds between amino acids are
**peptide bonds** and are covalent formed via condensation.

The folded patterns/areas of a protein make up the secondary structure.  There
are two possible fold patterns:

* Alpha helix - similar to a smooth spiral
* Pleated sheets - sharp turns/twist in the opposite direction

Some proteins only have the alpha helix, some only have pleated sheets, some
have both.  They're held together with hydrogen bonds in the nitrogen/hydrogen
atoms and carbon/oxygen atoms.

The tertiary structure is the final 3D shape of the protein.  There are also
two categories:

* Globular proteins: have an overall rounded or irregular shape
* Fibrous proteins: are long and cable-like

The tertiary structure is held together with various bonds in the R groups:

* Covalent bonds: the amino acid cysteine has a sulfhydrl group (-SH) in its
  R group.  When two are next to each other, they form a disulfide bridge which
  is covalent and strong.  It doesn't break when protein denatures.
* Ionic bonds: some R groups ionize in water and form ionic bonds.  They're
  weak in watery solution and will be lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrogen bonds: if a polar covalent bond forms, so do hydrogen bonds which are
  weak and will be lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrophobic interactions: some R groups are hydrophobic.  Water will push
  them together to form a bond.  These are weak and will also be lost if the
  protein denatures.

Some proteins will start to function as soon as they form their tertiary
structure.  Others require a quarternary structure.  These are large and complex.
They form multiple polypeptide chains.  The bonds that hold the polypeptides
together are the same bonds holding tertiary structures together, but only
with the R groups.  The hemogoblin protein in your blood is quarternary.

Proteins carry out many tasks:

* they're enzymes
* they reinforce structure like the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix
* they transport materials in/out of the cell in the plasma membrane
* they identify cells with glycoproteins on the membrane
* they help cells move (flagella)
* they help communicate via receptors or insulin
* they organize molecules.  Chaperone proteins help other amino acids fold into
  proteins.
* they defend the body against bacteria/viruses (antibodies)
* they regulate which parts of the DNA is used
