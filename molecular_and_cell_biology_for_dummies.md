Molecular and Cell Biology for Dummies
======================================

Rene Fester Kratz, PhD, teaches us microbiology without using jargon.  This
book was intended to help 2 audiences: students and self-learners.  It's
organized into 7 parts: intro to the cell, molecules, working cell, genetics,
molecular genetics, tools of molecular biology, and "part of tens".

Exploring the World of the Cell
===============================

Molecular/cellular biology is the study of cell structure/function down to the
individual molecules that make it up.  This chapter is an overview of the book.
Everything will be explained in greater detail in later chapters.

Cells are the smallest unit of life.  All living things are made up of cells,
including us.  Besides the cells that make us up, there are also prokaryotic
cells:

* Bacteria - they make us sick but do good things too
* Archaea - just as common but less known, recently discovered

Viruses are not cells.  They're smaller than bacteria and our eukaryotic cells.
They attack other cells and are parasitic.  Attacked cells may end up reproducing
more viruses.  Viruses are the cause of sore throats and HIV.

Cells require a lot of the same things we need:

* eating food or taking in a source of energy for cellular metabolism
* breathing oxygen or cellular respiration for energy
* using food/energy to grow and reproduce

You started life as a single cell, a combination of a sperm/egg.  Each of these
germ cells donated half of your genetic information (23 chromosomes each).

The instructions for each cell to work is encoded in DNA.  Every cell has a copy
of your DNA.  They're constantly reading it to build new molecules like proteins.
Proteins are created via transcription and translation.  Signals, like hormones,
can tell cells to change behavior.  Gene regulation allows cells to turn off
some genes and turn others on.

New technologies have been discovered which allow scientists to extract, read,
or modify DNA.  New branches of biology are opening up: 

* Bioinformatics - blending computing, biology, and IT to organize/analyze large
  amounts of biological information
* Genomics - study of entire genomes of organisms to learn/discover new proteins
  and genes
* Proteomics - study of proteins for different cells

Take a Tour Inside the Cell
===========================

All cells fall in one of three groups:

* Eucarya: plants, animals, fungi, and protists
* Bacteria: single-celled microorganisms
* Archaea: single-celled similar to bacteria

Cells of Eucarya are called **eukaryotic**.  They have a nucleus containing DNA
and organelles.  Bacteria/archaea cells are **prokaryotic**.  They don't have
a nucleus, their DNA floats within the cytoplasm.  They're typically smaller.

All living things are made up of cells.  Some are multicelluar - body is made
up of multiple cells.  Others are unicellular.

All cells contain:

* Plasma Membrane or Cytoplasmic Membrane - the boundary of a cell
* Cytoplasm - area inside cell
* DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid - plans for how cell is built and how it functions
* Ribosomes - structures where protein is built

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and have proteins on it.  The
proteins consist of receptors, which detect signals in the cell's environment,
and transport proteins.

The cytoplasm is crowded.  Most of the metabolism of a cell occurs here,
including the production of proteins.  The organelles move around in here.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is separated from the cytoplasm via the nucleus.  For
prokaryotic cells, DNA is in the cytoplasm area called nucleoid.

Ribosomes are the workbenches where proteins are made.  They're made up of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins.

The nucleus contains the cell's DNA, which is the instructions for the cell.
The boundary is called a nuclear envelope.  DNA is in the form of chromosomes
or chromatin (wounded up vs unwounded spaghetti-ish).  The cell reads the DNA
and builds ribosomal subunits in the nucleoli area of the nucleus and then
ships it out to the cytoplasm.

Molecules enter in/leave the nucleus via nuclear pores.  This includes:

* RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits
* proteins
* nucleotides - building blocks of DNA and RNA

The endomembrane system is the post office of the cell - it builds proteins and
lipids then ships them off.  There are a few components:

The endoplasmic reticulum is a component that starts at the nucleus and comes in
two types: rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  The
rough one has attached ribosomes used to deliver protein to a special
destination.

The Golgi apparatus will tag proteins before shipping them off.  The middle of
the ER is called a lumen.

Vesicles transport things around the cells.  Transport vesicles carry molecules,
lysosomes dispose of garbage, secretory vesicles bring materials to the plasma
membrane.

Peroxisomes help break down lipids.  This ends the endomembrane system...

The mitochondrion is the fireplace where cells burn their food via cellular
respiration.  Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell which transfer
energy from food to ATP (stored energy for the cell).

Chloroplasts make food molecules via photosynthesis and are only found in plant
cells.

The structure of the cell is supported by the cytoskeleton - kind of a scaffold
which holds the cell together.  They run though the cell providing a network
for vesicles/organelles to travel.  Cells flick with cilia and eukaryotic
flagella to move about.  Cytoskeletal proteins come in three groups:

* Microfilaments - make muscle cells contract and act as railroad tracks to
  a cell's organelles
* Microtubules - protein inside cilia and flagella
* Intermediate Filaments - reinforcing proteins for cells

The plasma membrane provides a selective boundary for the cell.  Most cells have
additional layers outside of it.  The layer around the animal cell is called the
extracellular matrix.

Dead or Alive: Viruses
======================

**Viruses** are microscopic particles of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and protein
that attack cells and turn them into virus factories.  They're responsible for
significant diseases: measles, influenza, polio, and AIDS.

Whereas bacteria are living cells, viruses are not.  They cannot do anything 
without hijacking a cell.  Scientists don't consider viruses to be alive.

The simplest viruses have two components: a **nucleic acid core** and a
**protein capsid**.  The DNA or RNA contains instructions for taking over cells
to produce more virions (viral particles) and the capsid is an outer shell.

Some viruses also have an outer envelope that they steal from the cell's
membrane.  They might also have proteins that stick out called **spikes**, which
help attach them to cells.

Viruses come in three shapes:

* helical - form of twisting helix around nucleic acid core
* polyhedral - regular geometric shape
* complex - separate patches of protein forming unique structures

Viruses attach to cells if they have the right viral protein that's accepted
by the cell's receptors.  They then dig a hole through the cell wall, slip in
by fusing with the cell membrane, or trick the cell into bringing it inside.
**Host range** is used to denote the type of cells a virus can infect.

**Bacteriophage** (phage = eat, so bacteria eater) are a type of virus which
attack bacteria.  In the lytic cycle, bacteriophage will use the cell to create
more phage and destroy it.  In the lysogenic cycle, bacteriophage will
enter during a dormant stage.  The host cell will reproduce - creating cells
which are infected.

Example steps of the lytic cycle:

1. Attachment - proteins of virus attach to receptors of bacteria
2. Penetration - genetic material of virus enters
3. Biosynthesis - virus uses host cell's nucleotides/amino acids to make more
   viral parts.  ATP from host cell supplies energy
4. Maturation - viral particles assemble into new virus
5. Release - virus leaves host cell, lysing or destroying as they leave

Bacteriophage that enter the lysogenic cycle remain inactive/dormant in the
bacteria for a while.  During this time, their DNA is integrated with the host
cell's DNA (now called **prophage**).  The steps are then: attachment,
penetration, recombination, replication.  Environmental signals will trigger
the virus to go into lytic cycle.

Viruses that attack eukaryotic cells are the same, but some terms are different:

* Latent instead of lysogenic
* Provirus instead of prophage
* Acute disease instead of lytic cycle

After an enveloped virus attaches to its eukaryotic host cell, it enters via
one of two ways:

* Fusion - envelope of virus  fuses with host cell's membrane, like two soap
  bubbles merging together
* Receptor-mediated endocytosis - the host cell is tricked, wraps the virus in
  a vesicle and brings it in

After entering, the virus removes its capsid (called **uncoating**) and releases
its genetic material into the host cell.  Viruses have different reproductive
strategies which are dependent on the class of virus:

* Double-stranded DNA viruses: ie smallpox, inserts its genetic material into
  the host's nucleus.  It gets copied whenever the host divides
* Retroviruses: ie HIV, single stranded RNA enters the host cell and reverse
  transcribes a double stranded DNA to insert into the nucleus
* Double-stranded RNA viruses: introduces their RNA into the cytoplasm to make
  viral proteins
* Single-stranded RNA viruses: negative-sense or positive-sense.  Negative like
  influenza, insert their RNA into cytoplasm to create new RNA and make proteins.
  Positive insert their RNA directly, doesn't need to create new RNA.

Viruses may use their own enzymes or host enzymes to copy genetic material.
Viral enzymes make more mistakes in host enzymes, causing mutations in viruses.
The variation makes it harder to defeat.

After the genetic material is copied, the viruses leave the host cell.  Sometimes
they leave via **budding**, pushing up against the membrane and taking a chunk of
it while leaving.  This helps disguise them as cells.

Putting it all together, the steps are: attachment, penetration, uncoating,
biosynthesis, maturation, release.

# Better Living Through Chemistry

Organisms are made of cells.  Cells are made of molecules.  Molecules are made
of atoms.  Atoms are made of subatomic particles.

Subatomic particles are protons (positive charge), electrons (negative charge),
and neutrons (no charge).  The nucleus of an atom is made of protons/neutrons
and the electrons orbit it.  The number of protons determine what element an
atom is.  It's called the **atomic number**.

An **isotope** has different numbers of neutrons than protons.  Carbon usually
has 6 protons/neutrons.  Carbon-5 is an isotope variation that has 5 neutrons.

Periodic tables often include the **atomic mass** of elements, which is the
average mass in atomic mass units of all atoms on earth for each element.  It's
the number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

Atoms form larger structures called **molecules** via chemical bonds.  This
will happen via:

1. Atoms share an electron to form a more stable structure
2. There is an attraction between opposite electrical charges

Each element has an electron configuration, which is useful in determining how
stable that element is.  Noble gases have an outer shell full of electrons, so
they're pretty stable.  **Valence electrons** are the electrons in the outermost
energy levels.  They're the electrons which are usually given/shared.

The **Periodic Table** will tell you how many valence electrons an element has.
Most atoms follow the octet rule, most of them want 8 electrons in its outer
shell.  Elements on the left side tend to want to give away electrons.  Elements
on the right side really want more electrons.  The tendency for an atom to
attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.

If one atom takes an electron, an **oxidation reduction reaction** or 
**redox reaction** has occurred.  The atom giving up an electron was **oxidized**
and the atom gaining an electron was **reduced** (think in term of charges).

For more information on electron configuration and chemical bonds, see notes on
Khan Academy's Chemistry lectures.

Whereas an isotope had differing numbers of neutrons, **ions** have different
number of electrons causing a charge.  **Ionic bonds** form due to electrical
attractions from opposite charges.  They're strong in solid form, but weak in
liquid form and in water.

**Covalent bonds** occur when atoms share an electron.  Two oxygen elements are
equally electronegative and they both benefit by sharing two electrons by
becoming more stable (rule of eights).

In a **polar covalent bond**, the electron spends more time orbiting the nucleus
of the more electronegative atom.  After polar covalent bonds form, they setup
the formation of **hydrogen bonds**.  Hydrogen bonds are weak electrical forces
between opposite ends of polar bonds.  They're like velcro.  Hydrogen bonds
hold the two helixes of your DNA together.

**Hydrophobic molecules** don't mix well with water.  Water has many polar and
hydrogen bonds.  When a molecule with polar bond is mixed in, it dissolves well.
When a covalent bonded molecule is mixed in, it's rejected - like water/oil.

Your body is 60-75% water.  Water is essential to living things:

* Water is a solvent.  Ions and polar molecules dissolve in water.  Water
  prevents them from forming solids.  All chemical reactions in cells occur
  in water.
* Water helps moves things across membranes.
* Water causes hydrophobic interactions.
* Water helps maintain the structure of important molecules.

Water molecules reach a equilibrium where H(2)O splits and forms hydrogen and
hydroxide ion:

    H(2)O <--> H^+ + OH^-

The concentration of hydrogen ions is measured in pH (-log of the molarity).
The concentration of hydroxide ions is measured in pOH.  A pH of 7 is neutral
on the acid/base scale.

Cells can only survive within a narrow range of pH - they prefer neutral.  Some
chemicals can add hydrogen ions and increase the pH of water.  These are acids.
Chemicals that remove hydrogen ions are bases.

Cells employ **buffers** to maintain the pH of water.  These buffers can release
hydrogen ions in a solution or remove them.  Your blood has the acid/base pair
of carbonic acid and bicarbonate to maintain your blood pH.

Cells often recycle and rebuild structures using existing molecules.  When a
structure is no longer needed, cells will break it apart to form a new one from
the pieces (different shape and recombining with different atoms).

There are four groups of macromolecules (big molecules) important to the cell:
carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.  All of them but lipids are
made up of the same repeating type of building block.  A long repetitive molecule
is called a **polymer**.  The building block of a polymer is a **monomer**.

Whenever a monomer is added to the polymer, a water molecules formed.  The
reaction is called **condensation or dehydration synthesis**.  Polymers can be
broken down into individual monomers via **hydrolysis** - a water molecule is 
inserted into the bond between two monomers to break it apart.

Remember hydro means water and lysis means breaking (as in when a virus lyces
from the cell - breaks out of).

Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are
=================================

Carbohydrates are made of carbons, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio of:

    CH(2)O

They're divided into two groups: monosaccharides and polysaccharides.  They're
also known as simple sugars and complex carbohydrates.

Monosaccharides have a backbone of 3-7 carbons and are called trioses, tetroses,
pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses.  They have Hydroxyl groups (OH) attached to
every carbon but one which make up sugars polar (and dissolves in water).

They have one double-bonded oxygen attached to the carbon backbone called a
carbonyl group.  If it's at the end, the sugar is an aldose.  If it's within
the backbone, it's a ketose.  It's not just the number of atoms which determine
what kind of simple sugar it is - the structure is important too.

Polysaccharides are multiple monosaccharides joined together by condensation
reactions (removal of water).  The bonds between them are glycosidic linkages.
They're classified by how many monosaccharides there are: disaccharides like
lactose, oligosaccharides (short chains), or polysaccharides (long chains).

Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for cells.  They provide
structural molecules for cells like the walls.  Cells are marked with
glycoproteins (proteins with sugar) to identify them.  They make a sticky matrix
around cells to help bacteria stick.

Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
=========================================

Most jobs in the cell are done by proteins.  The shape of a protein is essential
for its job.  They control metabolism, transport, communication, structure, 
division, and more.  They can specifically target a particular molecule or
process.

Proteins start as polymers of **amino acids**, also called a **polypeptide**.
Once that folds and becomes functional, it's a protein.  Some protein are made
of multiple polypeptides.

If a protein **denatures** (unfolds), it can no longer function.  Protein
structure or **conformation** is organized into 4 categories:

* Primary structure - sequence of amino acids
* Secondary structure - small areas folded into alpha helices and pleated sheets
* Tertiary structure - final 3D shape of one folded amino acid chain
* Quarternary structure - found in proteins consisting multiple folded chains

The cell contains 20 variants of amino acids.  The choice and ordering of these
amino acids makes up the primary structure of a protein.  Each amino acid has 
the same structure, a central carbon atom is bonded to 4 different chemicals:

* a nitrogen-containing amino group (-NH(2) or NH(3)+)
* a carboxyl group (-COOH or -COO-)
* a hydrogen atom (-H)
* A side chain (-R) that varies between the 20 amino acids

The N-C-C backbone pattern is useful in identifying amino acids.  You can use
it to distinguish proteins/carbohydrates.  The bonds between amino acids are
**peptide bonds** and are covalent formed via condensation.

The folded patterns/areas of a protein make up the secondary structure.  There
are two possible fold patterns:

* Alpha helix - similar to a smooth spiral
* Pleated sheets - sharp turns/twist in the opposite direction

Some proteins only have the alpha helix, some only have pleated sheets, some
have both.  They're held together with hydrogen bonds in the nitrogen/hydrogen
atoms and carbon/oxygen atoms.

The tertiary structure is the final 3D shape of the protein.  There are also
two categories:

* Globular proteins: have an overall rounded or irregular shape
* Fibrous proteins: are long and cable-like

The tertiary structure is held together with various bonds in the R groups:

* Covalent bonds: the amino acid cysteine has a sulfhydrl group (-SH) in its
  R group.  When two are next to each other, they form a disulfide bridge which
  is covalent and strong.  It doesn't break when protein denatures.
* Ionic bonds: some R groups ionize in water and form ionic bonds.  They're
  weak in watery solution and will be lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrogen bonds: if a polar covalent bond forms, so do hydrogen bonds which are
  weak and will be lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrophobic interactions: some R groups are hydrophobic.  Water will push
  them together to form a bond.  These are weak and will also be lost if the
  protein denatures.

Some proteins will start to function as soon as they form their tertiary
structure.  Others require a quarternary structure.  These are large and complex.
They form multiple polypeptide chains.  The bonds that hold the polypeptides
together are the same bonds holding tertiary structures together, but only
with the R groups.  The hemogoblin protein in your blood is quarternary.

Proteins carry out many tasks:

* they're enzymes
* they reinforce structure like the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix
* they transport materials in/out of the cell in the plasma membrane
* they identify cells with glycoproteins on the membrane
* they help cells move (flagella)
* they help communicate via receptors or insulin
* they organize molecules.  Chaperone proteins help other amino acids fold into
  proteins.
* they defend the body against bacteria/viruses (antibodies)
* they regulate which parts of the DNA is used

DNA and RNA: Instructions for Life
==================================

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are both polymers of
nucleotides.  DNA specifies which proteins and RNA to construct.

Nucleotides have 3 different components and make up nucleic acids.  Nucleic
acids can be single or double-stranded.  Chained together, they're called
polynucleotide chains.  The components of nucleotides are:

* A pentose (5-carbon) sugar - deoxyribose or ribose
* A nitrogenous base
* A phosphate group - a phosphorous atom surrounded by oxygen atoms

To navigate the nucleotides the carbon atoms are numbered from 1 to 5.  They're
also marked as prime: 1', 2', 3', 4', 5' to denote the difference between the
sugar carbons and nitrogenous base carbons.  The first carbon (1') is attached
to the nitrogenous base.  Numbers increase as we move away.

The pentose is different for DNA and RNA.  DNA has deoxyribose as its sugar
whereas RNA has ribose - the difference is just one oxygen atom.  Ribose has a
hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to its 2' carbon while deoxyribose only has a
hydrogen (-H).  Nucleotides are either ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide.
DNA is double stranded while RNA is single stranded.

There are five different nitrogenous bases found in nucleotides:

* Adenine (A)
* Guanine (G)
* Cytosine (C)
* Thymine (T) - only in DNA
* Uracil (U) - only in RNA

These bases fall into two groups.  Pyrimidines with a single ring structure and
two nitrogen atoms within the ring.  Purines have two fused rings with two
nitrogen atoms in each ring.  Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines.
Adenine and guanine are purines.

Polynucleotide chains give DNA its second structure: a double helix.  The sides
of the ladder are made of the sugar phosphate backbone.  The rungs are made
of nitrogenous base pairs with hydrogen bonds.  The sides are antiparallel,
if one side has its 5' carbon pointing up - the other has it pointing down.

Adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine.  Cytosine forms hydrogen bonds with
guanine.  The complementary base pairs are A=T, C=G. 

For RNA, it's A=U.  RNA can also have a 3d secondary structure.  They fold
upon themselves into complex shapes.

Our genetic code is encoded in those base pairs (A, T, C, and G).  Cells decode
DNA for many tasks:

* Protein structure: determined via transcription/translation.  Code in DNA is
  copied and used to specify amino acids sequence
* RNA structure: through the process of transcription
* Messenger RNA (mRNA): goes from DNA to ribosomes to produce proteins
* Transfer RNA (tRNA): decodes message from mRNA to match amino acids
* Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): part of the structure of the ribosome

Lipids: Waterproof and Energy Rich
==================================

**Lipids** are molecules that don't mix well with water.  Some lipids made by
cells include: fats, phospholipids, waxes, cholesterol, steroids, and sterols.

**Hydrocarbons** are molecules that have long chains of carbon atom bonded to
hydrogen atoms.  Lipids are hydrophobic because they contain non-polar covalent
bonds between carbon/hydrogen.

They're more diverse than the other three macromolecules (carbohydrates, 
proteins, and nucleic acids).  They're not polymers.  Their subcategories:

* Fats and oils: made of fatty acids attached to glycerol backbone
* Phospholipids: same as above but with unique hydrophilic group
* Waxes: fatty acids attached to long-chain alcohols
* Sterols: contain four fused carbon rings

**Fatty acids** are long chains of carbon and hydrogen.  Their 2 categories:

* Saturated fats: carbon atoms bonded with single bonds.  Carbon has 4 available
  bonds - this leaves 2 for hydrogens.
* Unsaturated fats: carbon atoms bonded with more double bonds.  These carbons
  can only bond with 1 hydrogen atom.

When three fatty acids join a glycerol backbone (three-carbon alcohol with
attached hydroxyl radicals) it's called **triglycerides**.

When you're trying to recognize lipid molecules, just remember that they're
hydrocarbons - they have chains of hydrogen/carbon molecules.

Triglycerides with high levels of saturated fat are called fats, while those
with unsaturated bonds are oils.  Fats are solid at room temp because the bonds
are more organized.  Oils are liquid at room temp due to unsaturated bonds.

**Phospholipids** are similar to triglycerides but only have two fatty acid
tails.

Lipids pack a lot of energy into a small space due to the carbon/hydrogen bonds.
They have 9 calories per gram while protein and carbohydrates only have 5
calories per gram.  Energy storage is the major function of lipids in cells.

Besides energy storage, lipids are also important for:

* insulation
* structure of plasma membranes
* water-proofing
* signaling - ie steroid hormones trigger changes in human development

Hello Neighbor, How Cells Communicate
=====================================

The plasma membrane of the cell is **selectively permeable** - molecules can
only pass through it the membrane allows it.  The major factors determining if
a molecule can/cannot pass:

* size: smaller molecules pass through easier
* attraction to water: hydrophobic molecules cross easier than hydrophilic.
  There's a hydrophobic interior of the phosopholipid bilayer.  Hydrophilic
  molecules require help from proteins to pass.

Transport proteins help control what can enter/exit a cell.  Most molecules
are too large or too attracted to water.  They can't cross without the help
of the transport proteins.

Molecules will evenly distribute between the interior/exterior of the cell.
**Diffusion** is the movement of molecules from higher concentration to lower
concentration to create an equilibrium.  It's called simple diffusion without
the help of transport proteins.  It's called facilitated diffusion with help.

There are two types of transport proteins that facilitate diffusion:

* Channel proteins: they're like soda straws.  Polypeptide chains build straw
  walls and create an open tunnel down the middle of the protein.  They form
  tunnels through the membrane filled with water for molecules to pass through.
  Some are always open.  Gated channels open/close in response to signals.
* Carrier proteins: Each carrier protein has a binding site made for a specific
  molecule type.  When it's binded, it changes shape and moves across.

Water also diffuses - it's called **osmosis**.  It's passive and requires no
energy from the cell.  Greater concentrations of water mean pure water and
less solutes.

* Hypertonic - solutions have a greater concentration of solutes
* Hypotonic - solutions have a lesser concentration of solutes
* Isotonic - solutions have equal concentration of solutes

Cells need to move molecules from where they're less concentrated to where
they're more concentrated - going against the flow.  They do this via 
**active transport**.  It requires energy from the cell, usually ATP.  For
example, carrier proteins change shapes using ATP from cells to carry molecules
inside.  These active transport carrier proteins are called **pumps**.

Multicellular organisms are made of a community of cells and it's important for
them to communicate, act distributed, request/respond.  **Attachment** of cells
form tissues.  **Communication** allows cells to coordinate signals/responses.

There are many types of attachments:

* tight junctions: so tight that water cannot pass through.  Proteins pass
  through membranes of both cells.  Important for tissue like skin so foreign
  molecules cannot pass through.
* anchoring junctions: hold cells tightly but allow molecules to pass through
  the space in between.  Important for tissue with structure but requires
  demanding work like heart tissue.

Anchoring junctions have subtypes:

* desmosomes: use cadherins in the membrane of both cells.  Cadherins proteins
  also with intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm of cells
* hemidesmosomes: anchor cells to extracellular matrix using integrins proteins.
* adherens junctions: anchor cells to each other and extracellular matrix

Between cells in almost all animal tissue are **gap junctions** formed by
connexins proteins.  They form rings on cell membranes called **pores**.  Two
cells may align the pores and form tunnels between each cell for ion and small
molecules to pass through.  Plant cells have similar tunnels called
**plasmodesmata**.

Signals from one cell will trigger a response in another far away - the signals
are called **hormones**.  The hormone insulin is produced by pancreas cells to
tell blood cells to take glucose out of the blood as a food source.

A cell can recognize signals only if it has a **receptor** for it.  Kind of like
the observer pattern.  They've got receptors in two locations: inside the cells
for signaling molecules which can cross the membrane, in the plasma membrane for
other molecules.

Receptor proteins have binding sites for signals.  When ligands - signaling
molecules - bind to these proteins, they change shape and set off a series of
events in the cell.  This process is called **signal transduction**.

A signal may be amplified via a **signal transduction pathway**.  This is similar
to the series of chain reactions of signal transduction.  They main difference is
the pathway can activate many secondary messengers at once.

Deactivating a signal happens when the primary messenger stops sending it.  Some
molecules in the cell are used to shut the messenger down: phosphatases,
activated G proteins, Ras proteins, and second messenger molecules.

Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
==========================================

Cells constantly convert energy/matter into different forms to get what they
need.  They store energy in food molecules and break it down to get it out.

**Metabolism** is all of a cell's chemical reactions - like breaking down food
molecules or building muscle proteins.  Your body breaks down food and converts
it into molecules you need.  **Catabolism** are reactions breaking larger
molecules into smaller one.  **Anabolism** is the opposite.

Let's review thermodynamics.  **Work** is moving something over a distance.
**Energy** is something you need to do work.  The first two laws are important
for molecular biology:

* Energy can't be created or destroyed
* Chemical reactions that occur spontaneously increase entropy (disorder) of
  an isolated system

Energy can be organized into **potential** or **kinetic** - from an object's
position/arrangement or energy from motion of molecules.

In cellular biology, spontaneous reactions are those that occur on their own
without the need for energy.  An example of this is diffusion, which follows
the second law.  Particles will flow from a concentrated area to less
concentrated without energy - because it increases the disorder.

Cells maintain their order by constantly using their stored energy to do
nonspontaneous reactions.

Kratz gives us a brick wall/pile analogy.  The brick pile is disorder and 
spontaneous.  A brick wall is organized and requires work and energy.  Over time,
the brick wall will become a pile of brick unless energy is used to maintain it.
Reactions that build large, complex molecules require energy.  Reactions that
break down to smaller molecules outputs energy.

**Exergonic** reactions release energy.  **Endergonic** reactions absorbs it.

You can determine if a chemical reaction is spontaneous or nonspontaneous by
looking at the changes in **free energy**.  Gibbs free energy (G) is used to
measure entropy/heat in a reaction.  A negative free energy (nG or deltaG) is a
spontaneous reaction:

    nG = G products - G reactants

Some of the work cells do:

* synthesis: build large/complex/structured molecules like DNA, proteins,
  membranes, or ribosomes
* organization: eukaryotic cells create compartments
* creation of electrochemical gradients: cells organize ions to cause differences
  in electrical charge which helps other reactions
* transport and movement

Cells break down food molecules for energy.  They use adenosine triphosphate,
better known as **ATP**:

1. Energy from food is transferred to ATP
2. ATP provides energy for cellular work

ATP is a nucleotide with the same building blocks as DNA/RNA: sugar ribose,
nitrogenous base, three phosphate groups.  Cells continually build/break down
ATP in ATP/ADP cycles.  They store energy by building ATP out of adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate groups.  They obtain energy by breaking ATP
back into those components (breaking it down requires water).

Metabolic changes are broken down into small steps, each a chemical reaction.
Several reactions in a series make up a **metabolic pathway**.  Enzymes speed
up chemical reactions by lowering the energy of activation.  Electrons are
transferred between molecules during metabolic reactions.  Energy is also
transferred during metabolic reactions.

Chemical reactions usually happen in many small steps instead of one quick
change so cells can control energy changes:

    A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F

The starting molecule A is called the **substrate**.  The ending molecule F is
the **product**.  B, C, D, E are called **intermediates**.

Spontaneous reactions are just waiting to occur.  All they need is the right
molecules to collide with just enough kinetic energy.  To initialize it, the
amount of energy needed to trigger is called **energy of activation (Ea)**.

**Enzymes** lower the energy of activation, making it easier/quicker for
reactions to occur.  Every cell reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme.  Enzymes
are very specific for substrates.  In the formula above (A->F), five enzymes
are used - one for each reaction.

**Productive collisions** are those with enough energy of activation for the
reaction to occur.  Reactants must: collide, be oriented correctly, and have
enough kinetic energy to overcome energy of activation.

Enzymes will bind substrates in their active sites and move them into the
correct orientation.  They can alter chemical bonds making reactions more likely.

Electrons are usually transferred during metabolic reactions.  **Oxidation** is
when a molecule gives up an electron.  **Reduction** is when a molecule gains
an electron (reduced in charge).

Metabolism is all about getting what you need:

* building blocks for growth/repair
* energy for cellular work
* reducing power

Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
===========================================

## Overview

When you eat food, your digestive system breaks it down into small molecules.
Your cells break it down further for energy.  The metabolic pathway to break
food or capture stored energy for cells is called **cellular respiration**.
It breaks down 3 of the important macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins,
and fats.

1. During respiration, electrons are removed from food molecules and transferred
   to an electron carrier NADH, then to oxygen (O2)
2. At the end, the energy from the food is transferred to ATP
3. Through chemical reactions, food is rearranged to waste products - carbon
   dioxide and water

Glucose is the starting point:

    C(6)H(12)O(6) + 6O(2) -> 6CO(2) + 6H(2)O + energy  # ignores intermediaries

Burning a marshmallow or paper shows the stored energy.  You're converting the
sugars into carbon dioxide and water.  The energy becomes heat and light.

During respiration, glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced.  When this
electron is moved, it's part of a hydrogen atom.  The products are in a more
stable state - so it's an exergonic reaction.  The energy gets transferred to
ATP, a storable form.

Cells actually go through many steps for this reaction.  Here's a rough overview:

1. Glycolysis - oxidation of glucose begins, electrons transferred to NAD+.
   Small amount of energy transferred to ATP.  Occurs in cytoplasm.
2. Krebs Cycle - continues oxidation of intermediaries resulting in CO(2).
   Occurs in the mitochondrion of the cell.
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain) - transfers electrons
   from carriers to electron transport chain.  Reduction of oxygen to produce
   water.  Also occurs in mitochondrion of cell.

## Glycolysis

Glycolysis is a series of chemical reactions resulting in:

* oxidation of glucose
* transfer of small amount of energy to ATP
* transfer of electrons to carrier NAD+

The major events are:

1. Bonds in glucose break and reform creating two molecules of pyruvate
2. Enzymes transfer energy from ATP to intermediaries as the energy investment
   phase.  Then more energy gets transferred back as the energy payoff phase.
   For every molecule of glucose, 2 ATPs used and 4 comes back.
3. Enzymes oxidize glucose and reduce NAD+ -> NADH+H+

Some cells rely on glycolysis without the krebs cycle and electron transport
chain.  They usually have a 2nd fermentation step to recycle the NADH.
Lactic acid fermentation occurs if the hydrogen atoms is transferred to pyruvate,
causing the NADH to become NAD again.  Alcohol fermentation removes a carbon and
two oxygens from pyruvate and releases CO(2), resulting in acetaldehyde - which
the NADH gives its hydrogen to.  Reduced acetaldehyde is ethanol (or alcohol).

## Krebs Cycle

The krebs cycle picks up after glycolysis, continues to oxidize the
intermediates, and transfers energy.

The major events are:

1. Enzymes oxidize intermediates and reduce electron carriers
2. Enzymes break bonds and rearrange atoms in intermediates, removing carbon and
   oxygen atoms and releasing them as CO(2)
3. Enzymes transfer energy to ATP

This produces a total of 2 ATPs per glucose.

## Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain)

Chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation - a big name to explain how
energy and electrons from food help make ATP.  By the end of glycolysis a cell
hasn't made much ATP but has made many reduced electron carriers: NADH+H+ and
FADH(2).  These molecules can cash those electrons to make ATP.

**Electron transport chains** are made of large protein complexes embedded in
a membrane.  They accept electrons and pass them from complex to complex.  They
have an enzyme called ATP synthase.  During oxidative phosphorylation, protons
enter a small channel in ATP synthase and exits on the matrix side.  The synthase
has binding sites for ADP and P.  Every three molecules provides enough energy
for the synthesis of one ATP from ADP and P.

The most electronegative molecule in the electron transport chain is O(2).  The
proton ends up there, which is why H(2)O is a waste product of respiration.

## Breaking Complex Carbs, Proteins, and Fats

Food molecules besides glucose need to change into intermediates in glycolysis
or the Krebs cycle before being oxidized.

Of all the food molecules, carbohydrates are the easiest to digest because many
of the intermediates in glycolysis are carbohydrates.  Simple sugars, like
glucose, don't need an extra step.  Complex carbs are just polymers of simple
sugars, so it's also easy to break down.

Enzymes called lipases break fats/oils down into glycerol and fatty acids.
These two are then fed to cellular respiration.  Glycerol is a 3-carbon compound
that's an intermediate to glycolysis.  Fatty acids are broken into 2-carbon 
fragments, then acetyl-CoA - an intermediate of the Krebs cycle.

Proteins require the most work.  They're polymers, so they get broken down into
their building blocks.  Then enzymes make major alterations to the amino acids
so they become intermediates to glycolysis or the Krebs cycle.

## Anabolism (building new molecules) in Respiration

Cellular respiration must break down many molecules before building new ones.
It's a two way street.  Catabolism breaks down food molecules, but anabolism
builds new molecules from the intermediates.

If a cell needs to build a macromolecule, the intermediates can be used from
cellular respiration to build it.

## In the Real World

We all know "eat less, exercise more" leads to losing weight.  This is partly
due to cellular respiration.

Exercising causes cells to use more ATP and increase the amount of ADP.  ADP
stimulates enzymes in cellular respiration, triggering an increase in the
breakdown of food molecules.

If you combine this with the decreased food, cells will have to use the currently
stored food molecules to fuel respiration.  They turn to stored fat.

Photosynthesis: Makin' Food in the Kitchen of Life
==================================================

## Overview

Plants, algae, and some bacteria do photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis uses energy
from the sun, matter from CO(2), H(2)O to form carbohydrates.  With these
carbohydrates and some minerals, living things can build all the molecules needed
for life: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.

Photosynthesis summarized is this chemical reaction:

    6CO(2) + 6H(2)O + light energy -> C(6)H(12)O(6) + 6O(2)

Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms rearrange to form glucose and oxygen.  The
reactants come from the air and soil.  The products end up in the plant body
(sugars) or waste back into the atmosphere (oxygen).

Light energy from the sun becomes chemical energy stored in the bonds of sugar.

## What Plants Need

Plants are **autotrophs**, meaning self-feeding, they can make their own food.
Plant structures are specialized to take in materials:

* Roots take water from the soil
* Xylem, tubes of cells for water transport, moves water from roots throughout
  the plant
* Phloem, tubes of cells for sugar transport, moves sugars from green leaves to
  the rest of the plant
* Stomates, pores on leaves, let carbon dioxide into leaves
* Chlorophyll, green pigment on leaves, absorb light

Plants don't need the soil.  It's useful for them to stand in and get water from.
Also, minerals from the soil sometime help with metabolism - but they're not
necessary.

They just need the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Plants capture the electromagnetic radiation within the visible light band from
the sun for photosynthesis.

## Calvin Cycle and Light Reaction

Photosynthesis is made up of multiple small reactions.

In light reactions, plants capture light energy from the sun and transform it
into chemical energy in the form of ATP.  They also take electrons from H(2)O
and transfer them to electron carrier NADPH.

In the Calvin cycle, plants capture CO(2) and convert it into carbohydrates.
To do this conversion, they need the ATP and NADPH's electrons from the light
reactions.

## Photosynthesis in the Real World

Carbohydrates made by plants, algae, and bacteria serve as the food for all
life on Earth.  Plants are on the bottom of every food chain.  Autotrophs
make their own food, heterotrophs eat autotrophs:

    Sun -> Grass -> Cow -> Human

You can see how the energy from the sun eventually makes its way to you.
