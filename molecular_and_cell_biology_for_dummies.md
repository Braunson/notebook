Molecular and Cell Biology for Dummies
======================================

Rene Fester Kratz, PhD, teaches us microbiology without using jargon.  This
book was intended to help 2 audiences: students and self-learners.  It's
organized into 7 parts: intro to the cell, molecules, working cell, genetics,
molecular genetics, tools of molecular biology, and "part of tens".

Exploring the World of the Cell
===============================

Molecular/cellular biology is the study of cell structure/function down to the
individual molecules that make it up.  This chapter is an overview of the book.
Everything will be explained in greater detail in later chapters.

Cells are the smallest unit of life.  All living things are made up of cells,
including us.  Besides the cells that make us up, there are also prokaryotic
cells:

* Bacteria - they make us sick but do good things too
* Archaea - just as common but less known, recently discovered

Viruses are not cells.  They're smaller than bacteria and our eukaryotic cells.
They attack other cells and are parasitic.  Attacked cells may end up reproducing
more viruses.  Viruses are the cause of sore throats and HIV.

Cells require a lot of the same things we need:

* eating food or taking in a source of energy for cellular metabolism
* breathing oxygen or cellular respiration for energy
* using food/energy to grow and reproduce

You started life as a single cell, a combination of a sperm/egg.  Each of these
germ cells donated half of your genetic information (23 chromosomes each).

The instructions for each cell to work is encoded in DNA.  Every cell has a copy
of your DNA.  They're constantly reading it to build new molecules like proteins.
Proteins are created via transcription and translation.  Signals, like hormones,
can tell cells to change behavior.  Gene regulation allows cells to turn off
some genes and turn others on.

New technologies have been discovered which allow scientists to extract, read,
or modify DNA.  New branches of biology are opening up: 

* Bioinformatics - blending computing, biology, and IT to organize/analyze large
  amounts of biological information
* Genomics - study of entire genomes of organisms to learn/discover new proteins
  and genes
* Proteomics - study of proteins for different cells

Take a Tour Inside the Cell
===========================

All cells fall in one of three groups:

* Eucarya: plants, animals, fungi, and protists
* Bacteria: single-celled microorganisms
* Archaea: single-celled similar to bacteria

Cells of Eucarya are called **eukaryotic**.  They have a nucleus containing DNA
and organelles.  Bacteria/archaea cells are **prokaryotic**.  They don't have
a nucleus, their DNA floats within the cytoplasm.  They're typically smaller.

All living things are made up of cells.  Some are multicelluar - body is made
up of multiple cells.  Others are unicellular.

All cells contain:

* Plasma Membrane or Cytoplasmic Membrane - the boundary of a cell
* Cytoplasm - area inside cell
* DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid - plans for how cell is built and how it functions
* Ribosomes - structures where protein is built

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and have proteins on it.  The
proteins consist of receptors, which detect signals in the cell's environment,
and transport proteins.

The cytoplasm is crowded.  Most of the metabolism of a cell occurs here,
including the production of proteins.  The organelles move around in here.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is separated from the cytoplasm via the nucleus.  For
prokaryotic cells, DNA is in the cytoplasm area called nucleoid.

Ribosomes are the workbenches where proteins are made.  They're made up of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins.

The nucleus contains the cell's DNA, which is the instructions for the cell.
The boundary is called a nuclear envelope.  DNA is in the form of chromosomes
or chromatin (wounded up vs unwounded spaghetti-ish).  The cell reads the DNA
and builds ribosomal subunits in the nucleoli area of the nucleus and then
ships it out to the cytoplasm.

Molecules enter in/leave the nucleus via nuclear pores.  This includes:

* RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits
* proteins
* nucleotides - building blocks of DNA and RNA

The endomembrane system is the post office of the cell - it builds proteins and
lipids then ships them off.  There are a few components:

The endoplasmic reticulum is a component that starts at the nucleus and comes in
two types: rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  The
rough one has attached ribosomes used to deliver protein to a special
destination.

The Golgi apparatus will tag proteins before shipping them off.  The middle of
the ER is called a lumen.

Vesicles transport things around the cells.  Transport vesicles carry molecules,
lysosomes dispose of garbage, secretory vesicles bring materials to the plasma
membrane.

Peroxisomes help break down lipids.  This ends the endomembrane system...

The mitochondrion is the fireplace where cells burn their food via cellular
respiration.  Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell which transfer
energy from food to ATP (stored energy for the cell).

Chloroplasts make food molecules via photosynthesis and are only found in plant
cells.

The structure of the cell is supported by the cytoskeleton - kind of a scaffold
which holds the cell together.  They run though the cell providing a network
for vesicles/organelles to travel.  Cells flick with cilia and eukaryotic
flagella to move about.  Cytoskeletal proteins come in three groups:

* Microfilaments - make muscle cells contract and act as railroad tracks to
  a cell's organelles
* Microtubules - protein inside cilia and flagella
* Intermediate Filaments - reinforcing proteins for cells

The plasma membrane provides a selective boundary for the cell.  Most cells have
additional layers outside of it.  The layer around the animal cell is called the
extracellular matrix.
