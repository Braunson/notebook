Power of Habit
==============

Charles Duhigg shows us the science behind habits.  He explains why they exist and how they can be
changed.  The first four chapters are the core, teaching us the basics of habits.  The remaining
chapters offers us case studies of how habits are implemented in the world.

# TLDR How to Implement a New Habit

1. Pick a Cue
2. Choose a Reward
3. Execute the Routine
4. Experiment with different cues/rewards until routine sticks

Example: I want to go to the gym every day.

Step 1: I'll leave my running shoes by the door.  Or set a phone alarm at 7PM every day.  Or I'll
find an exercise buddy to call.  You can use one or multiple cues.

Step 2: After going to the gym, I'll reward myself with a piece of chocolate.  Or I'll spend 30
minutes on Facebook.  Or I'll watch an episode of Game of Thrones.

Step 3: Over the next week, I'll test out different cue/reward combinations.  7PM -> gym -> chocolate.
Shoes -> gym -> TV.  Eventually, I find out that around 7PM, I'll start craving for an episode of
Game of Thrones!  That's a new habit loop that will stick with me.

Step 4: I'll write down this new habit (studies show writing it down will help make it sticky).

    Every day at 7PM, I'll go to the gym.  When finished, I'll watch one Game of Thrones episode.

# Habit Loop

The loop is made up of:

1. a cue, which triggers the brain
2. an activity, which becomes more automatic overtime
3. a reward, which reinforces the habit

# Craving Brain

Scientists worked with monkeys to create a habit loop: see picture -> push lever -> get juice.
At first, brain activity spiked at receiving juice.  This was associated to pleasure.  After many
iterations, the spike occurred when seeing the picture.  Removing the juice, the spike was replaced
with frustration instead.

We can train ourselves using the habit loop.

# Golden Rule of Habit Change

How to break an existing habit: you can't.  But you can replace the activity.

The cue cannot be changed.  The reward is difficult to change, removing it will only present
frustration.  Instead, identify the cue/reward and replace the activity.  Overtime, the new activity
will become automatic.

Often times, only the activity is known.  You'll have to figure out what the cue/rewards are before
you replace the activity.

# Keystone Habits

Alcoa was a company in financial trouble until a new CEO took over and changed one keystone habit:
safety.  He focused the entire company.  By the next year, profits were soaring high.

Focusing on a keystone habit makes it easier to create/change a habit.  That change triggers more.
Alcoa's safety habits triggered autonomy in employees.  Autonomy triggered more communication.
It eventually became better efficiency in every facet of their work.

# Starbucks and Habit of Success

Willpower is the ability to control yourself and the strong determination that allows you to do
something difficult.

Willpower can be strengthened.  Starbucks has a rigorous training program that instills
self-discipline into its employees.  They're trained to recognize cues from customers which triggers
habit routines.

# Power of a Crisis

A crisis can be used to catalyze change and create new habits.  In London, a fire which claimed
many lives in the underground changed how the public transportation system worked.  Before it was
a system or independent groups, each feared treading on the other one's territory.  Now, each group
can offer suggestions and feedback.

# How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do

Data mining is used to predict what customers want.  For example, Target uses data mining on its
customers to determine which one of them will be pregnant - before even they know.  They'll use this
information to send advertisements to the family's home.

Consumers tend to form habits around which products they buy.  They stick with the same brand and
store.  Companies know this and will try to get you hooked on them.

# Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott

The bus boycott of Montgomery were initiated by habits of friendship and personal connections.
Weak social ties and peer pressure spread the boycott.  Can't get to work without the bus?  You'll
be driven out of your social group if you can't figure it out.

The author mentioned how groups work well in forming new habits previously.  The same group habit
theme was used when discussing Alcoholics Anonymous.

# Neurology of Free Will

Habits are used by casinos to create addicted gamblers.  Cues are all over the casino: alcohol,
sounds, and lights.  The brain develops the habit, even if you don't want it.
