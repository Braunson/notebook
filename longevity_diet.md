The Longevity Diet
==================

By Brian Delaney and Lisa Walford, this book is an introduction to calorie
restriction diet or CR diet as used for longevity.

What is the Longevity Diet?
===========================

It's a diet with a goal to reduce chances of suffering age-related diseases
like cancer, heart-disease, or diabetes.  It's flexible and emphasizes eating
healthy, nutrient-rich foods while reducing empty calories.  

Most people refer to it as "CR" for calorie restriction.  It was made popular by
Roy Walford, a gerontology researcher.  Many researchers have examined subjects
by reading biomarkers before/after starting CR.  The average age improves for
animals on CR diet.  No long term studies on humans have been done (as it would
be unethical and take too long), but short term studies have yielded great
results on biomarkers.

The authors give examples of what daily meals are like for different
individuals.  Some are strict, some are relaxed.  A typical day might be:

* tea in the morning, light soy-protein lunch, big salad with fruit for dinner
* whole-grain cereal with fruit in morning, skipped lunch, large salad dinner
* salad for breakfast, mixed fruit/nuts and tea for lunch and dinner

Authors recommend contacting the CR Society International or other experts
if you have any questions about CR.

How the Longevity Diet Can Change Your Life
===========================================

Research involving animals on CR diets have shown that it increases the maximum
life span much more dramatically than exercise, antioxidants, and so on.  There
has also been indicators that youthful traits still exist in older ages such
as maze runs and reproduction.

There has not been any human studies other than short-term ones which record
biomarkers.  Humans on CR diets tend to show significant changes in their
biomarkers which are associated with less risk of heart disease, cancer,
diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and other age-related diseases.

Clive McCay accidentally discovered the longer term effects at Cornell University
while studying stunted growth in mice.  More recently, CR has been shown to
improve insulin sensitivity.  Insulin enables cells to use glucose, overtime
our cells become less responsive to insulin which leads to high levels of glucose
and diabetes.  Glucose is like gas, too much can cause damage.  We need just
enough to keep our bodies running.  CR improves insulin sensitivity by lowering
the amount of glucose in our bodies.

CR has been shown to reduce the amount of DNA damage in our bodies and that
telomere length seems to increase.  There's also a reduction in oncogenes.
Laboratory animals on extreme CR have a reduced decline in sexual activity with
age.  There have also been signs of lowered blood pressure and reduced risk
of arthritis.  The authors include references to each research paper.

There is a catch.  Bodies tend to experience lower temperatures on CR diets.
If you're already underweight, this is not a good diet for you.  Reducing
calories will result in losing weight.

ABCs of Nutrition
=================

Your body needs a certain amount of protein, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and
calories.  CR aims to get that nutrition while reducing caloric intake.  Ratios
are important.

Proteins are made up of amino acids.  There are twenty kinds, eight of which
are essential because the human body cannot synthesize it.  In Western cultures,
it's very easy to get the proteins you need.  Some protein is better than other
proteins because it has the essential eight amino acids (like egg).

Lipids are also known as fat.  The ratio of fatty acids is important.  The fat
found in fish, nuts, and seeds are better to eat than the fats found in
vegetable oils.  Lipids include fatty acids, triglycerides, sterols, waxes,
phospholipids, and lipoproteins.  They're used to make cell walls and hormones.
Every single lipid can be made by the body except for omega-3 and omega-6
fatty acids.  You need to maintain a good balance of both.  Omega-6 fatty acids
tend to trigger issues like arthritis and high blood pressure.  Omega-3 combats
this.  Western cultures tend to have foods high in omega-6.  So eat more foods
that contain omega-3.

Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients.  They're not directly used in the
body but act as supplements to help build other essential materials.  You need
a little bit of a lot of variety.  Too much of any single vitamin or mineral
will have harmful effects.  You can get this by eating a variety of fruits
and veggies (think a variety of colors).

Calories fuel your body and comes from carbohydrates, lipids, protein, and
alcohol.  For the CR diet, we're trying to reduce the amount of calories while
making sure you get the necessary nutrition.

Some basic guidelines to follow:

* cooking plants break down cell walls making nutrients more accessible
* cooking too much can remove essential nutrients
* steaming veggies until they become soft is a good compromise, or try eating
  both raw and steamed veggies in one meal
* include as many unprocessed foods as practical (whole-grain instead of white
  bread, corn instead of corn chips)
* eat a variety of fruits and veggies
* don't eat a lot of meat, particularly fatty meat
* eat legumes and grains if you're a vegetarian
* get at least 20 minutes of aerobic exercise at least 3x week

Your Calories, Your Life
========================

This chapter covers the current theories of aging and how CR might effect it.
The current recommended calories for moderately active men of average size is
2500/day.  For women it's 2000/day.

Both aging and how CR affects it are all theories.

**Disposable Soma** - disposable body - this theory says individuals are
disposable so long as the species can survive.  On CR, you're tricking your body
into thinking food is scarce.  It begins to act differently in order to survive.
For a species, if food is scarce it makes sense that individuals must remain
youthful longer so that reproduction can occur at a later stage (thus waiting
until food is more available).

**Antagonistic Pleiotropy** - some genes are beneficial to use early in our
lives but antagonistic later on.  IGF-1 helps us grow early but accelerates
aging later.  Cell senescence is required to prevent cancer but could cause use
to grow older.

**Rate of living** - the faster you live the sooner you'll die.  Humans on CR
use their body's energy more efficiently.

**Immunological** - similar to antagonistic pleiotropy, some antibodies in your
body attack parts of it.  These tend to multiply with age.  CR reduces the
amount of this autoantibodies.

**Neuroendocrine** - network of brain cells, hormones, and glands govern the
homeostasis of your body.  Over time, the hypothalamus gets damaged and
regulates hormone less effectively.  Animals on CR tend to retain their youthful
hormone regulation longer.

**Cellular Senescence** - most cells divide less than fifty times by the time we
die due to the hayflick limit and perhaps telomeres.  Animals on CR experience
less telomere shortening during DNA replication.

**Wear and Tear** - the general theory that your system gets damaged overtime
as we use it causing aging.

**Glycemic** - we have a lot of glucose floating in our system.  Too much fuel
causes collateral damage.  Glucose molecules spontaneously binds to amino acids
in proteins, changing its structure and functions becoming advanced glycation
end-products (AGEs).  CR lowers average levels of circulating glucose.

**Free Radical** - this theory says free radicals cause havoc in our systems
because they steal electrons from molecules causing a domino effect.
