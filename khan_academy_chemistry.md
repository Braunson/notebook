Introduction to the Atom
========================

**Atom** is the Greek word for uncuttable.  It's actually made up of neutrons,
protons, electrons.  The nucleus is made up of neutrons/protons and the electrons
"orbit" around the nucleus.

**Orbital** is the probability function where you're likely to find an electron.

An **electron** has negative charge.  A **proton** has positive charge.  A
neutron has a neutral charge.  The further away an electron is from the nucleus,
the more potential energy the atom has because opposite charges attract.

The number of protons in an element will identify it and is known as the
**Atomic Number**.

Each proton/neutron is 1 **Atomic Mass Unit** =~ 1.67x10^27kg.  An element's AM
is the number of protons + number of neutrons.

The **Atomic Weight** is included in the periodic tables.  Carbon has an atomic
weight of 12.0107.  If you average all Carbon elements, the average number of
neutrons is 6.0107.  Carbons usually have 12 neutrons, but an **isotope** exists
with Carbon-14 (14 neutrons).  An isotope is just an element with a different
version with a different number of neutrons.

The nucleus is about 1/10,000 of the total volume of an atom.  If you look at
your hand, 99.999% of it is just vacuum.

Orbitals
========

The electron can be thought of as a sphere around the nucleus.  We only know
the probability of the location of an electron.  It's denser as you get to the
center.

The **Bohr** model uses an orbit, where the electron has a path around the
nucleus.  It's similar to the planet orbiting around the sun.  The further away
an electron is from the nucleus, the more energy there is.

Orbits further away are known as being "higher".  An electron can stay in a
higher orbit if the lower orbit is already occupied - due to repelling negative
charges.

Elements can have different orbital shapes depending on the number of electrons
they have and which **period** or row they're in the periodic table.  See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital>.

For example: Hydrogen has 1 proton.  Assuming it's neutral, it has 1 electron.
It'll go into the first energy shell (1s energy shell).  The
**electron configuration** is 1s^1 which is just a sphere that's dense in the
middle.

Helium's electron configuration is 1s^2.  So within the first energy shell,
there's two electrons.  Lithium's is 1s^2*2s^1.  That's two electrons in the
first shell and one electron in the second shell.

More on Orbitals and Electron Configuration
===========================================

The further away an electron is from the nucleus, the higher its energy state.
Electrons want to occupy the lower orbits/energy states first.  You can think
of it like stacking blocks (start low).  Electrons cannot be crammed into the
same orbital because they'll start repelling each other.

We started with 1s and 2s.  Next are the P orbitals: Pz, Px, Py.  They're
dumbbell shaped orbitals that are horizontal, vertical, and along the z-axis.
They fill in the order of z-axis, x-axis, y-axis.

Carbon's electron configuration are: `1s^2*2s^2*2p^2`

The two left columns of elements will fill the S orbitals.  The 6 right columns
will fill the P orbitals (except Helium, which should be moved to the S orbital
columns).  The middle 10 columns belong in the D orbitals.  The island 14 columns
(which are actually placed in between the D orbital columns) will occupy the
F orbitals.

You can always double-check your configuration by counting the number of
electrons.  For the Carbon above, that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Electron Configurations
=======================

The D shells are different.  The number shell should actually be the period
minus one.  So Mn should occupy 3d^6 at its highest orbital even though it's
in the 4th period.  The ending configuration of Mn is: `4s^2*3d^6`

Although the 3d shell is higher energy than 4s, 4s is actually the outer shell.
The electrons in the outer shell are the **Valence Electrons** and they're
often used in Chemistry.

The ending configuration of La is: `6s^2*4f^1`.  The F shell uses the period
of an element minus two.  So the La periods is in the 6th period, but its F
shell electrons are the 4th F shell.

Electron Configurations 2
=========================

The electron configuration for Nickel is:

    1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^8

Although 3d^8 has higher energy, 4s^2 electrons are the furthest away and
will be used in most Chemical reactions.  They're Valence electrons.

Sal shows us a great trick to write out electron configurations:

      | s | p | d | f
    1   o 
    2   o   o
    3   o   o   o
    4   o   o   o   o

Use the chart above to fill out configurations in a diagonal matter.  Start with
1s, then 2s, then 2p 3s, then 3p 4s, and go on.

Or you can just use the periodic table and work backwards.  The periodic table
may be less error prone.

Valence Electrons
=================

There's a shorthand for writing out electron configuration, for Lithium it's:

    [He] 2s^1

That is, it's the same as Helium's electron configuration with an extra electron
in the 2s shell.  For Iron it's:

    [Ar] 4s^2 3d^6

It takes more energy to cram an electron in 3d than 4s because it's crowded,
even though the electrons in 4s are further away.

On the periodic table, the **groups** are the columns.  Everything in groups
3 to 12 will have 2 electrons in its outer-most shell.  This is because the
new electrons occupy a lower d-shell.  Everything in group 2 will have 2
electrons in its outer-most shell also.  Listing out electrons in the outer-most
shell for each group:

* Group #1: 1
* Group #2: 2
* Group #3 to #12: 2
* Group #13: 3
* Group #14: 4
* Group #15: 5
* Group #16: 6
* Group #17: 7
* Group #18: 8 (except Helium)

For Selenium:

    [Ar] 4s^2 3d^10 4p^4

In the fourth shell, there are 2 electrons in the S orbital and 4 electrons in
the P orbital.  That totals for 6 electrons in the outer-most shell - which is
correct for group #16.

The **valence electrons** or outer-most electrons are all we care about in
reactions.  There's a shorthand notation which only takes outer electrons into
account:

     H. for one electron (middle-align the dot!)
     F: for two valence electrons
    :C: for four valence electrons

All atoms want to have **8 electrons** in their outer-most shell because it's the
most stable state.

Potassium (K) has 1 valence electron.  Potassium (Cl) has 7 valence electrons.
If you put K in the presence of Cl, K's electron will jump to Cl.

Alkali metals really want to get rid of their electrons, especially when close
to Halogen elements.  Except for Hydrogen, cause its only got one!

Groups of the Periodic Table
============================

* Group #1 are the Alkali Metals (except Hydrogen)
* Group #2 are the Alkali Earth Metals and want to give away 2 electrons
* Groups #3-12 are the Transition Metals
* Groups #13-16 have a mix of Metals and other
* Group #17 are Halogens
* Group #18 are the Noble Gases

Alkali Metals are seldom found in their elemental state.  They're highly reactive
and usually combine with other elements.

When electrons are added to Transition Metals, they just backfill their previous
D orbitals.  They just want to lose their 2 outer electrons.  Metals are very
giving with their electrons.

Metals are great conductors because they have surplus electrons which can move
around easily.

As we get to group #13 (with 3 outer electrons), atoms are less likely to want
to get rid of their electrons.  Electrons closer to the nucleus are harder to
give up, while electrons further away are easier.  That's why metals trend to
the bottom elements of the periodic table.

Hydrogen used to be used as a gas, but it was very combustible because it always
reacted with other elements.  Now, Helium is used because it has its outer shell
full and doesn't like to react with other elements.

Periodic Table Trends: Ionization Energy
========================================

**Ionization Energy** is the energy required to remove an electron from the 
neutral version of the atom.

An **ion** is an atom with a different number of protons and electrons.  They
have charges.

    H -> H^+1 + e^-1

`H^+1` is a **cation**, an ion with a positive charge.  An **anion** is an ion
with a negative charge.

Group #1 (Alkali Metals) require very little energy to remove an electron.  It
requires very little energy to ionize them.

Electrons which are further away, it gets easier to take them away.  So elements
near the bottom of the periodic table require lower ionization energy then
the top elements.

The energy trend for the table is:

    Low -> High
            |
           Low

Other Periodic Table Trends
===========================

**2nd Ionization Energy** is the energy required to remove the 2nd electron
from the neutral version of an atom.

A **covalent bond** occurs when atoms share electrons.  If you have an oxygen
atom and two hydrogen atoms, they'll share electrons.  Hydrogens will fill its
1s shell and oxygen will its 2p shell.  Both will be in a more stable state.

When drawing it out, a line usually means a covalent bond:

      ..       ..
    H:O:H    H-O-H
      ..       ..

**Electronegativity** is the measure of how likely an atom will hog an electron
in covalent bonds.  Halogen Gases react often and have high electronegativity.
Alkali Metals have low electronegativity because they want to get rid of their
electrons.  It's the same trend direction as ionization energy.

**Metallic Nature** is the willingness to give away electrons.  It's sort of
the opposite of electronegativity.  The bottom left elements have a high
metallic nature and the top right elements have a low one.

**Atomic Radius** is the length between the nucleus and outer shell.  As you
go down the periodic table, the atomic radius is increasing.  Moving right, size
decreases due to an increase in protons/coloumb force (without adding a new
shell).

Ionic, Covalent, and Metallic Bonds
===================================

Atoms stick together and form **molecules**.

         .          ..
    Na. :Cl: -> Na :Cl: (Na^+1 + Cl^-1)
         ..         ..

Sodium gives away its electron and chlorine gets one. They both become ionized
and are attracted to each other.  They form an **ionic bond**.

     .. ..    ..   ..
    :O  O: ->  O = O
     .. ..    ..   ..

These oxygen atoms are sharing two electrons each and form a **covalent bond**.
This usually occurs in atoms which are similar with each another.

A **polar covalent bond** is a specific type of covalent bond where one atom
has higher electronegativity and the other.  Each atom gets a partial charge.

If you put together a lot of iron, they share their electrons.  They all get
a positive charge and create an excess of electrons.  The atoms become attracted
to the pool of electrons around them.  This is a **metallic bond**.
