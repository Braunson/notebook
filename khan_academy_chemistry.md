Khan Academy: Chemistry
=======================

The Khan Academy has over 2,400 videos covering science, math, and more.  These
are my notes from Salman Khan's chemistry videos.  For the full videos, see

Introduction to the Atom
========================

**Atom** is the Greek word for uncuttable.  It's actually made up of neutrons,
protons, electrons.  The nucleus is made up of neutrons/protons and the electrons
"orbit" around the nucleus.

**Orbital** is the probability function where you're likely to find an electron.

An **electron** has negative charge.  A **proton** has positive charge.  A
neutron has a neutral charge.  The further away an electron is from the nucleus,
the more potential energy the atom has because opposite charges attract.

The number of protons in an element will identify it and is known as the
**Atomic Number**.

Each proton/neutron is 1 **Atomic Mass Unit** =~ 1.67x10^27kg.  An element's AM
is the number of protons + number of neutrons.

The **Atomic Weight** is included in the periodic tables.  Carbon has an atomic
weight of 12.0107.  If you average all Carbon elements, the average number of
neutrons is 6.0107.  Carbons usually have 12 neutrons, but an **isotope** exists
with Carbon-14 (14 neutrons).  An isotope is just an element with a different
version with a different number of neutrons.

The nucleus is about 1/10,000 of the total volume of an atom.  If you look at
your hand, 99.999% of it is just vacuum.

Orbitals
========

The electron can be thought of as a sphere around the nucleus.  We only know
the probability of the location of an electron.  It's denser as you get to the
center.

The **Bohr** model uses an orbit, where the electron has a path around the
nucleus.  It's similar to the planet orbiting around the sun.  The further away
an electron is from the nucleus, the more energy there is.

Orbits further away are known as being "higher".  An electron can stay in a
higher orbit if the lower orbit is already occupied - due to repelling negative
charges.

Elements can have different orbital shapes depending on the number of electrons
they have and which **period** or row they're in the periodic table.  See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital>.

For example: Hydrogen has 1 proton.  Assuming it's neutral, it has 1 electron.
It'll go into the first energy shell (1s energy shell).  The
**electron configuration** is 1s^1 which is just a sphere that's dense in the
middle.

Helium's electron configuration is 1s^2.  So within the first energy shell,
there's two electrons.  Lithium's is 1s^2*2s^1.  That's two electrons in the
first shell and one electron in the second shell.

More on Orbitals and Electron Configuration
===========================================

The further away an electron is from the nucleus, the higher its energy state.
Electrons want to occupy the lower orbits/energy states first.  You can think
of it like stacking blocks (start low).  Electrons cannot be crammed into the
same orbital because they'll start repelling each other.

We started with 1s and 2s.  Next are the P orbitals: Pz, Px, Py.  They're
dumbbell shaped orbitals that are horizontal, vertical, and along the z-axis.
They fill in the order of z-axis, x-axis, y-axis.

Carbon's electron configuration are: `1s^2*2s^2*2p^2`

The two left columns of elements will fill the S orbitals.  The 6 right columns
will fill the P orbitals (except Helium, which should be moved to the S orbital
columns).  The middle 10 columns belong in the D orbitals.  The island 14 columns
(which are actually placed in between the D orbital columns) will occupy the
F orbitals.

You can always double-check your configuration by counting the number of
electrons.  For the Carbon above, that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Electron Configurations
=======================

The D shells are different.  The number shell should actually be the period
minus one.  So Mn should occupy 3d^6 at its highest orbital even though it's
in the 4th period.  The ending configuration of Mn is: `4s^2*3d^6`

Although the 3d shell is higher energy than 4s, 4s is actually the outer shell.
The electrons in the outer shell are the **Valence Electrons** and they're
often used in Chemistry.

The ending configuration of La is: `6s^2*4f^1`.  The F shell uses the period
of an element minus two.  So the La periods is in the 6th period, but its F
shell electrons are the 4th F shell.

Electron Configurations 2
=========================

The electron configuration for Nickel is:

    1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^8

Although 3d^8 has higher energy, 4s^2 electrons are the furthest away and
will be used in most Chemical reactions.  They're Valence electrons.

Sal shows us a great trick to write out electron configurations:

      | s | p | d | f
    1   o 
    2   o   o
    3   o   o   o
    4   o   o   o   o

Use the chart above to fill out configurations in a diagonal matter.  Start with
1s, then 2s, then 2p 3s, then 3p 4s, and go on.

Or you can just use the periodic table and work backwards.  The periodic table
may be less error prone.
