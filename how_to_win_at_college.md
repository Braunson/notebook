How to Win at College
=====================

Cal Newport offers simple rules to follow for success at college.  Here, success
means getting good grades without taking up too much time.  It's the perfect
balance of academics, enthusiasms, achievements, and a social life.  This book
is presented as a list of rules to follow.  I may have additional notes for some
of the rules.

**Don't do all of your reading**

Don't read everything listed on the syllabus.  Just skim the main required
reading - note the intro/conclusion and skim everything else.  Try to note
the question/evidence/conclusion.

Newport argues that most learning will happen in lectures.  Use your reading
notes along with lectures to absorb the material.  Most exams are also based
on the lectures - reading just amplifies your understanding.

**Create a Sunday ritual**

Use Sunday to jump-start the work-week.  Maybe go for a run to trigger your brain,
then use it as a productive day to do work/study.

**Drop classes every semester**

Drop classes before the deadline.  Newport suggests signing up for extra classes
to evaluate them.  Drop your least favourable courses.

**Start long-term projects the day they're assigned**

**Make your bed (be organized)**

**Apply to ten scholarships a year**

Scholarships look impressive on a resume and so few people apply to them.  By
applying to multiple, you increase your odds of getting one.

**Build study systems**

Repetitive study systems work.  They let you follow a series of small steps to
absorb material.

**Befriend a professor**

Professors are great mentors.  Establish a professional relationship with them.
Use office hours.  It's a two-way street, make sure you don't annoy them with
useless visits.  For courses, it's great to get a second opinion on: thesis,
outlines, problem sets, difficulties.  Some professors may grow an interest into
your personal academic/career goals.

**Become a club president**

**Read a newspaper everyday**

**Do one thing better than anyone else you know**

Newport suggests getting good at one skill just for self-confidence.

**Avoid daily to-do lists**

They don't work, instead use the schedule system noted in How to Become a
Straight-A Student.

**Learn to give up**

Be effective and efficient.  If a class or commitment is taking up too much of
your time and isn't providing enough - give up.  Of course, you shouldn't just
drop classes and get an F.

**Never Nap**

Instead of napping, batch up menial chores like vacuuming or doing the dishes.

**Sign up for something your first week**

**Always be working on a "Grand Project"**

Winning students love to get excited about big goals.  If you want to stand out,
foster the attitude that "anything is possible".  Picture yourself five years
down the road.  Design a "Grand Project" that works you towards the goal.

**Take art history and astronomy**

**Blow the curve once a term**

Put yourself in the situation at least for one class, once a semester.  Get the
best grade on a single project/paper/exam.  It helps your grade and helps the
professor remember you.

It's too hard to do this for every course/project.  Choose one, interesting
project and start extremely early.

**Ask one question at every lecture**

This works particularly well for discussions.  The night before a lecture/class,
draft down a possible set of questions.

**Jump into research as soon as possible**

Research is where all the action is.  It looks great for graduate school
applications.  You can help professors work on their projects and get to know
them in the process.  It's exciting.  Get involved and learn.

**Pay your dues**

During your first year of assisting original research, you'll need to pay your
dues.  This means doing the grunt work and taking one for the team.

**Study in fifty minute chunks**

Do not "passively study".  Passive studying is locking yourself in a library
and studying all day.  Your mind isn't focused and it takes too long.  It's
better to have fifty minute chunks of focus than a whole day of unfocused work.

After every 50 minutes of studying, take a 10 minute break.  It's even better
to have meals in between 50 minute chunks - breaking them apart throughout the
day (or before/after classes).

**Schedule your free time**

Instead of thinking "free time is the time you're not scheduled for working",
think "working is the time you're not scheduled for recreation".

Choose a specific time to end each day.  Make sure you have ample time to wind
down before going to bed.

**Dress nicely for class**

**Decorate your room**

**Start studying two weeks in advance**

It's easier to absorb material when you spread it out.  It's also easier to
avoid procrastination.  It's less stressful to spread the workload.

**Write outside of class**

Writing is the number #1 most important skill coming out of college.  Master it.

**Eat alone twice a day**

Eating socially usually ends up in long meals.  Eating takes up a lot of time
and money: going out, cooking, doing dishes.  Try to minimize it.

**Find an escape**

Examples: long jog, bookstore reading, coffee shop reading

**Take hard courses early on**

**Don't study in your room**

**Don't study in groups**

The best way to absorb material is by studying it yourself with a lot of
concentration.

**Join an honors program**

**Do schoolwork every day**

Do a little bit everyday lets you stay in the zone.  This reminds me of
Seinfeld's calendar.  He makes a big X everyday he practices comedy - to show
that he's working to get better.  Avoid slumps.

**Attend guest lectures**

**Exercise five days a week**

Exercising gives you a boost in physical/mental energy!  Don't let it become
debatable - make it a morning habit.

Newport recommends doing quick bursts.  Schedule at least one hour to get to the
gym, exercise, and get back.

**Stay in touch**

**Tack on an extra major or minor**

**Meet often with your adviser**

**Don't get a normal job**

Don't work retail, don't serve food, don't paint houses.  Try to find a
strategic job at your college.  One that's in your field or in your academic
department.  Or find a job that's not too demanding and allows ample time to
study - like at a library help desk.

**Use three days to write a paper**

This only applies to those short papers - quick essays that only account for
5% or less of your grade.

**Don't under-sleep, don't over-sleep**

**Relax before exams**

**Make friends your #1 priority**

**Don't binge drink**

**Ignore your classmate's grades**

**Seek out phenomenal achievers**

Expose yourself to the possibility of doing better.  Look for people with a
list of accomplishments that you want to emulate.  You'll find out it's possible,
and maybe learn how to do it yourself.
