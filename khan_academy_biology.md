Khan Academy: Biology
=======================

These are my notes from Salman Khan's Biology videos.  Full the full videos,
see <http://www.khanacademy.org>.

Introduction to Evolution and Natural Selection
===============================================

**Evolution** and natural selection are tightly integrated.  Most people
think of a giraffe, who started out with a short neck which got longer at each
generation for utility.  That's not the case.

In any given species, there are **variations**.  Blue vs green eyes, short vs
tall, etc...  Khan gives the example of pepper moths.  A part of the
population had white spots on them.  After the industrial revolution, trees
got polluted with soot.  Predators had a harder time hunting moths with solid
black colors.  This is called **natural selection**, the variation with the best
chance of survival becomes popular.

Intelligent Design and Evolution
================================

**Intelligent Design** argues that some species/organs are so complex and awe
inspiring that there's no way it was an act of random natural selection.

Deoxyribonucleic Acid
=====================

**DNA** stands for **deoxyribonucleic acid**.  It's what codes all of our genetic
information.

DNA is structured as a double-helix.  There are two helixes, intertwined with
each other that are connected by bridges.  The helixes are made up of Phosphate-
deoxyribose.  The brides are made up of:

* Adenine
* Thymine
* Guanine
* Cytosine

The bridge is always made up of two molecules.  Adenine always pairs with
thymine.  Guanine always pairs with cytosine.  When DNA strands are written,
we usually just use the first letters of each molecule.

    ACTG  // example strand
    TGAC  // example pairing

There **human genome** has 3 billion base pairs.

A strand of DNA will go through **transcription** and transcribe a pairing
**RNA** or **ribonucleic acid**.  In RNA, instead of a Thymine there's a
**Uracil**.  The transcribed RNA is actually called mRNA or messenger RNA.

    ATGCACGTA  // example DNA strand
    UACGUGCAU  // example transcribed RNA strand
 
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes into the cell's cytoplasm and to ribosomes.
At the ribosomes, it's **translated** to proteins.
