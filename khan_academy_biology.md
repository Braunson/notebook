Khan Academy: Biology
=======================

These are my notes from Salman Khan's Biology videos.  Full the full videos,
see <http://www.khanacademy.org>.

Introduction to Evolution and Natural Selection
===============================================

**Evolution** and natural selection are tightly integrated.  Most people
think of a giraffe, who started out with a short neck which got longer at each
generation for utility.  That's not the case.

In any given species, there are **variations**.  Blue vs green eyes, short vs
tall, etc...  Khan gives the example of pepper moths.  A part of the
population had white spots on them.  After the industrial revolution, trees
got polluted with soot.  Predators had a harder time hunting moths with solid
black colors.  This is called **natural selection**, the variation with the best
chance of survival becomes popular.

Intelligent Design and Evolution
================================

**Intelligent Design** argues that some species/organs are so complex and awe
inspiring that there's no way it was an act of random natural selection.

Deoxyribonucleic Acid
=====================

**DNA** stands for **deoxyribonucleic acid**.  It's what codes all of our genetic
information.

DNA is structured as a double-helix.  There are two helixes, intertwined with
each other that are connected by bridges.  The helixes are made up of Phosphate-
deoxyribose.  The brides are made up of:

* Adenine
* Thymine
* Guanine
* Cytosine

The bridge is always made up of two molecules.  Adenine always pairs with
thymine.  Guanine always pairs with cytosine.  When DNA strands are written,
we usually just use the first letters of each molecule.

    ACTG  // example strand
    TGAC  // example pairing

There **human genome** has 3 billion base pairs.

A strand of DNA will go through **transcription** and transcribe a pairing
**RNA** or **ribonucleic acid**.  In RNA, instead of a Thymine there's a
**Uracil**.  The transcribed RNA is actually called mRNA or messenger RNA.

    ATGCACGTA  // example DNA strand
    UACGUGCAU  // example transcribed RNA strand
 
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes into the cell's cytoplasm and to ribosomes.
At the ribosomes, it's **translated** to proteins.

The mRNA bonds with tRNA molecules or **Transfer RNA**.  The tRNA themselves are
attached to 20 different amino acids.  **Amino Acids** are the building blocks
of protein and can be coded by 3 different bases (4^3).  The tRNA molecules
act like trucks for the amino acids.

      UAC CUG   <-- mRNA
      AUG GAC   <-- tRNA, 3 base pairs is also called a Codon
      ||| |||
    AMINO-ACIDS <-- form protein

The amino acids start to bond with each other when they're close.  Once they
bond the tRNA detaches.  The amino acids form a chain and start folding into
complex patterns to form proteins.

Proteins range from 150 amino acids (450 base pairs) to 1500 amino acids (4500
base pairs).  Proteins then perform functions in our biological systems like
helping to transport blood.

A **Gene** is a portion of our chromosome which codes for a specific function or
protein.  Each variant of a gene is called an **Allele**.

DNA winds around on itself.  When it's all bundled up into a large portion, it's
called a **chromosome**.  We have 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Each cell in your
body have copies of your DNA/chromosomes.  The largest chromosome (chromosome 1)
has 220 million base pairs.
