@link(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_effect)
The generation effect refers to the robust finding that information will be 
better remembered if it is generated rather than simply read. For example, 
you are more likely to remember the word "orangutan" if you generate it from 
the fragment "or_ng_ta_" than if you simply see the word in its entirety.

This directory will hold notes of books and documents for this purpose.
