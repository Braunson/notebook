Small Move, Big Change
======================

By Caroline L. Arnold - ever make a New Year resolution and completely failed?  Arnold comes up with
Microresolutions, small changes that we make to create or eliminate habits resulting in big
improvements.

The Seven Rules of Microresolutions
===================================

Part 1 covers what a microresolution is and how to make one yourself.  There are seven rules:

**1. A microresolution is easy.**  Don't make resolutions you can't keep.  Instead of walk everywhere
all the time, think walk to work every Monday.  Instead of being on a 100% healthy diet, think adding
one apple per day.  Your microresolution must be absolutely achievable.  It must be a solid commitment
you know will be done.

**2. A microresolution is an explicit and measurable action.**  It's more about doing than being.
Instead of being more organized, commit to putting away your mail in an inbox immediately after
receiving it.  Instead of being a novelist, commit to writing ~2 sentences every night after brushing
your teeth.  Instead of getting a good night sleep, commit to going to bed by 9PM everyday.  You'll
notice every commitment has a cue.  A good habit is always prefixed with a cue (your cue can even
be an existing habit.)

**3. A microresolution pays off up front.**  Your time frame is today instead of someday.  Instead
of keeping the house neat at all times, have a specific time to make your bed - perhaps every
morning after you wake up.  Losing twenty pounds is a goal, not a microresolution.  Instead commit
to stop eating everyday after 8PM.  The reward for your habits must be for the short-term (although
it can and will probably have long term benefits also.)

**4. A microresolution is personal.**  The more specific your resolution is, the better.  Think
carefully about which behaviors you can change to achieve your desired outcome.  Arnold wanted to
arrive to work on-time more, so she decided to prepare her cash/keys/transit card when she came
home from work instead of in the mornings.  She also wanted to lose weight, a resolution that many
failed.  It was as simple as coming up with a new personal habit: to chew her food slowly by dining
leisurely and savoring foods/drinks.

**5. A microresolution resonates.**  Attach a specific message to your microresolution and give it
a positive spin.  It's hard to stick to the habit: chew your food slowly.  Instead, Arnold changed
the message to: I resolve to dine leisurely and savor my food and drink.  By creating a message
that resonates, you'll make your microresolution easier to accomplish!  There's also the special
zero-tolerance microresolutions.  Sometimes it's easier to follow a rule 100% than to give yourself
any doubt.  For example: no eating after 8PM is easier to do than don't eat late.  If you're hungry,
you may bend the meaning of "late".

**6. A microresolution fires on cue.**  We go on autopilot as a result of triggers and cues, such
as waking up to an alarm or eating unhealthy snacks which are readily available.  When you make
your microresolution, include a cue for which to trigger it.  For example: after I brush my teeth
I will write 2 sentences for my novel.  The opposite holds true for quitting bad habits.  If you find
yourself constantly eating unhealthy snacks, figure out what the cue is and eliminate it.  Make it
more difficult to eat those bad snacks.

**7. Make microresolutions just two at a time.**  Resist the urge to do too much at once.  Practice
makes perfect.  It's better to achieve everlasting change than to attempt too much and fail after
a short period of time.  It may take months before your new habits stick.  Wait until those habits
are on autopilot until you attempt more.
