Zen Habits: Handbook for Life
=============================

Leo Babauta of [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.com) fame put together this
collection of best articles.  It's about living simply, being productive, and
being happy.  I think this made a great companion to "Guide to the Good Life:
The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy".

Simplicity
==========

**Decluttering**

Simplify the physical things in life by decluttering your home.  Take everything
out of the shelf/drawer and sort it through three piles: trash, give away, keep.
Try to be merciless.

**Single-tasking**

Don't juggle (tasks) like the Ringling Bros.  Multi-tasking is less efficient
and more complicated.

Instead, work on your most important tasks first thing in the morning.  Turn off
distractions like the internet or cell phones.  Focus but take breaks every now
and then.

**Edit Your Commitments**

Edit your life - cut out everything that's not necessary to make it more
meaningful.

List out all the commitments you have.  Now ask yourself if it's important,
if it will further your life goals, is it in line with your priorities?

Some common categories: work, side work, family, kids, civic, religious,
hobbies, home, and online.

Take time to edit your commitments to greatly simplify your life.

**Eliminate All but the Essentials**

You've got a long list of projects and tasks that will never be done.  Identify
the essential and eliminate the rest.

- eliminate tasks and projects
- know what's essential
- simplify your commitments
- simplify your information streams (RSS, newspapers, TV, blogs, etc...)
- identify and accomplish the big rocks
