Zen Habits: Handbook for Life
=============================

Leo Babauta of [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.com) fame put together this
collection of best articles.  It's about living simply, being productive, and
being happy.  I think this made a great companion to "Guide to the Good Life:
The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy".

Simplicity
==========

**Decluttering**

Simplify the physical things in life by decluttering your home.  Take everything
out of the shelf/drawer and sort it through three piles: trash, give away, keep.
Try to be merciless.

**Single-tasking**

Don't juggle (tasks) like the Ringling Bros.  Multi-tasking is less efficient
and more complicated.

Instead, work on your most important tasks first thing in the morning.  Turn off
distractions like the internet or cell phones.  Focus but take breaks every now
and then.

**Edit Your Commitments**

Edit your life - cut out everything that's not necessary to make it more
meaningful.

List out all the commitments you have.  Now ask yourself if it's important,
if it will further your life goals, is it in line with your priorities?

Some common categories: work, side work, family, kids, civic, religious,
hobbies, home, and online.

Take time to edit your commitments to greatly simplify your life.

**Eliminate All but the Essentials**

You've got a long list of projects and tasks that will never be done.  Identify
the essential and eliminate the rest.

- eliminate tasks and projects
- know what's essential
- simplify your commitments
- simplify your information streams (RSS, newspapers, TV, blogs, etc...)
- identify and accomplish the big rocks
- go for biggest values instead of quantity
- batch small tasks

**Declutter Your Mind**

Some tips for decluttering the mind:

1. breathe
2. write it down
3. identify the essential
4. eliminate
5. journal
6. rethink sleep
7. take a walk
8. watch less TV

Productivity
============

**Purpose Your Day: Most Important Tasks**

Your MIT is the task you most want or need to get done today.  In Leo's case,
he has three MITs everyday which he does first thing in the morning.  Get them
out of the way and feel accomplished for the rest of the day.

**Focus on the Big Rocks**

The Big Rocks are what you want to get done most this week.  Leo suggests
getting these out of the way early in the days.  Then fill in the rest of the
day with sand/pebbles - the smaller tasks that need to get done but aren't as
important.

**Clear Out Your Inbox**

This is the same concept as Inbox Zero, delete your email as they come in.

Don't check email first thing in the morning.  When you do, dispose of it right
away.  Have only one folder: "Archive".

**Clear Your Desk**

Have a clear desk except for the one thing you're working on.

Take everything on/in your desk and process them: trash it, delegate it,
file it, do it.  Do this daily to keep your desk clear.

**Become an Early Riser**

Leo has a habit of waking up at 4:30AM every morning.  This has a few benefits:

1. Let's you greet the day
2. Let's you have a slow start instead of a morning rush
3. Quietude
4. Enjoy the sunrise
5. Have time for breakfast
6. Get exercise
7. Productive due to no distractions
8. Goal time
9. Easier commute
10. Easier early appointments

**Become Motivated When You're in a Slump**

Some things to help during a slump:

1. Have _One Goal_
2. Find inspiration
3. Get excited from your inspiration and _One Goal_
4. Post your goal and commit publicly
5. Think about it daily
6. Get support
7. Think about benefits instead of difficulties
