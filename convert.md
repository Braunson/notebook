Convert

Ben Hunt shows us how to make web sites that converts visitors.  This is broken
up into two parts: getting traffic and designing for conversion.

How to Transform Your Web Site's Success
========================================

The "First Best Guess" approach to web design doesn't work anymore.  It involves
too much guesswork when we can measure results.  If you build it, they will not
come.

Instead you need two things: traffic and conversion.

    Success = Traffic * Conversion

Zero traffic means zero success.  Zero conversions means zero success.  The
sweet spot is finding where investing minimal effort on traffic and conversion
will result in success.

Hunt advocates testing different approaches - multiple landing pages - and
continually measure the response and altering.

Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
=======================================

SEO falls into two categories: what the page says it's about and what the rest
of the web says it's about.  The latter is more important in terms of your
search engine rankings.

Do keyword research.  Use the Google Keyword Research tool to estimate the
amount of traffic using a particular keyword phrase.  To measure competition,
use the Google query format:

    allintitle: your potential keyword phrase

This finds pages where your keywords are in the `title` tag - these are the
websites you're competing with.  Consider the amount of sites and check the
top sites' Page Ranks.  Competing with ~100 sites where the top site has a PR of
1 or 2?  Not a problem.  Competing with ~100,000 sites where the top sites have
a PR of 7 or 8?  Big problem, don't even try.

Be sure to use synonyms and different phrases to try to find phrases that are
less competitive.

The **Long Tail** will usually produce more results for you in the long run.
These are the less competitive keyword phrases that are longer.  Instead of
competing on "bookkeeping software", think "how to use bookkeeping software for
estimated taxes".  Instead of "New York lawyers" think "New York City lawyers
specializing in divorces".

Hunt recommends using Market Samurai or WordTracker.

For on-page SEO, make sure your **keyword density** (the targeted keyword phrase
repeated on the page's content) falls around 2% to 4%.  But optimize for human
readers, not the search engines.  Also make sure the `title` tag, URL, and `h1`
uses your keyword phrase.

To build inbound links, write great original content that people will link to.
Email blogs and other relevant sites your content.  Relevancy matters.  Internal
links are also helpful, but not as powerful as backlinks.

Expanding Your Reach
====================

You're selling solutions to a problem.  Your product is a solution.  Research
your market and identify the problems they have.  List many problems and a
solution (using your product) for each.

**Flip products to propositions and flip features to benefits.**

Instead of selling a flint tool, sell "how you can carve meat in less time
before the wolves show up."

By concentrating on benefits instead of features, you're concentrating on the
customer more than yourself.  A feature is all about our product and what it
does.  A benefit is something your product does FOR your customer.

**Flip "Us" to "You".**

Hunt gives an example of an inexpensive web hosting provider.  They view
themselves as "inexpensive" or "low cost", but the term "cheap web hosting
package" delivers a lot of traffic with low competition.  That's what customers
are searching for.  Is it worth changing the brand from "low cost" to "cheap"
to attract more traffic?

Using the Awareness Ladder
==========================

The old website model was to have one homepage, individual pages dedicated to
each product/service, and one checkout page:

    H -> (P/S) -> $

But putting up a landing page is so cheap.  Having a single homepage that lists
out all your features dilutes the message.  You're not targeting a single problem
anymore, you're listing out problems that your product can solve.  It's better
to create multiple landing pages, each highly specific to a single problem.  This
serves customers much better (a hyper specialized message targeting a specific
niche offering a solution will convert much better):

    (multiple O) -> (P/S) -> $

What sort of landing pages should you make?  First think about the
**Awareness Ladder**, everyone in the market of your product:

0. Experiencing problem, but don't think it's an issue.
1. Experiencing and realizing it's a problem, but unaware of any solutions.
2. Aware of some solutions, but don't know about your product.
3. Know about your product, but don't know why it's better than your competitors.
4. Convinced of your product's benefits, but not committed to purchase.
5. Ready to purchase your product.

As the website designer, you need to have insight into the ladder.  Which level
is this particular landing page targeting?  Its job is to get the visitor to
take a step up to the next ladder.

0. No Problem ->
1. Problem ->
2. Solutions Exist ->
3. Your Solutions ->
4. Benefits ->
5. Convinced -> Sale

Every product/service usually has a bulge on the ladder, where most of the
market exists and where you should concentrate.  Launching to a new market?
Everyone is at step 0, you have to convince them it's a problem worth solving.
Launching a product competing with other products?  The bulge is around steps
3 and 4.  Answer these:

* what's their current level of awareness?
* what are they looking for right now?
* what are they open to at this point?
* what will get their attention?
* what next step can you invite them to take?
* what do you need to convince them of for the next step to make sense?

The lower on the ladder, the harder and more expensive it is to market to.  You
should consider if it's worth it.  On the other hand, perhaps your competitors
are ignoring that portion of the market - so it could be ripe for you.

**Building a lot of landing pages goes hand in hand with SEO.**  Each landing
page is targeted towards a long tail keyword phrase.  The competition is lower
and long tail searches will make up the majority of your traffic over the long
term.

Step 0 pages usually won't exist on your own site, it creates a sense of a need
and guides the reader to step 1 pages.  Step 0 doesn't even have to be web pages,
it could be done in advertisements.

Step 1 pages should communicate that solutions exist and link to Step 2 pages.
They may also introduce your solution (Step 3) - steps can be combined onto a
single page (but don't combine too many!)

Step 2 offers solutions.  They should target keyword phrases like "best and
repellent".

Step 3 introduces your product as a solution.  Don't just put a generic list of
problems, be specific and target a niche.

Step 4 lists out all the benefits of your product, which can also be specific
towards a niche problem.  Convince the prospects with your proposition.  Resolve
their fears and doubts (maybe use testimonials or logos).  Establish trust.

Step 5 is to close the sale.

Visitors can come into your funnel from any step, they don't have to start at
the beginning.  To create a lot of content, think about:

    (Problems) x (Treatments)

The permutation of the two will create a matrix of content you can use.  A third
variable can be geographic references.
