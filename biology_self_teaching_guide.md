Biology: A Self-Teaching Guide
==============================

Steven Daniel Garber teaches us Biology.  This book had high reviews on
Amazon for being easy to understand but still thorough.

Origin of Life
==============

First there were one-celled organisms, which evolved to multicellular organisms.
Cells began to specialize and evolved into plants/animals.  Scientists agree that
our solar system formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.

Creationists believe the Bible is completely accurate and that the world was
created in 6 days.  Scientists use the scientific method to test hypotheses and
theories and develop concepts/ideas.

**Spontaneous generation** is the belief that living organisms came from
nonliving material.  Aristotle thought insects came from moist soil.  Francesco
Redi tested this with meat in closed jars in 1668 to disprove it.  Louis Pasteur
further disproved it with experiments on bacteria.

The **vitalist doctrine** believes there's a vital force guiding life - not just
the laws of physics.  Since 1870s, most scientists agree that organisms arise
from reproduction of pre-existing organisms.

The conditions for life originated through a series of chemical reactions.
Heavy materials sank to the earth core, while lighter materials rose.  Hydrogen
combined with Oxygen to form water.  Minerals arose from volcanic eruptions to
form land.

Scientists began to experiment to find out how life began from inorganic
compounds billions of years ago.  In 1950s, Stanley Miller duplicated the early
chemical conditions of Earth.  When warm water/gases combined with sparks to
form chemical reactions - organic compounds were formed.

Clays serve as a catalyst to life.  It stores energy, transforms it, and releases
it in a form for chemical reactions.  They may be the first self-replicating
systems.

Scientists began to propose how life came from outside of Earth.  Maybe seeds
were carried in from the Moon or meteorites brought in germs.  This was
discounted because germs could not survive in -220C degrees conditions.
Re-entry would certainly burn off any survivors.

The evidence of our chemical evolution on Earth is lost.  Scientists are now
searching on other planets/moons/comets/asteroids to look for evidence.
