Biology: A Self-Teaching Guide
==============================

Steven Daniel Garber teaches us Biology.  This book had high reviews on
Amazon for being easy to understand but still thorough.

Origin of Life
==============

First there were one-celled organisms, which evolved to multicellular organisms.
Cells began to specialize and evolved into plants/animals.  Scientists agree that
our solar system formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.

Creationists believe the Bible is completely accurate and that the world was
created in 6 days.  Scientists use the scientific method to test hypotheses and
theories and develop concepts/ideas.

**Spontaneous generation** is the belief that living organisms came from
nonliving material.  Aristotle thought insects came from moist soil.  Francesco
Redi tested this with meat in closed jars in 1668 to disprove it.  Louis Pasteur
further disproved it with experiments on bacteria.

The **vitalist doctrine** believes there's a vital force guiding life - not just
the laws of physics.  Since 1870s, most scientists agree that organisms arise
from reproduction of pre-existing organisms.

The conditions for life originated through a series of chemical reactions.
Heavy materials sank to the earth core, while lighter materials rose.  Hydrogen
combined with Oxygen to form water.  Minerals arose from volcanic eruptions to
form land.

Scientists began to experiment to find out how life began from inorganic
compounds billions of years ago.  In 1950s, Stanley Miller duplicated the early
chemical conditions of Earth.  When warm water/gases combined with sparks to
form chemical reactions - organic compounds were formed.

Clays serve as a catalyst to life.  It stores energy, transforms it, and releases
it in a form for chemical reactions.  They may be the first self-replicating
systems.

Scientists began to propose how life came from outside of Earth.  Maybe seeds
were carried in from the Moon or meteorites brought in germs.  This was
discounted because germs could not survive in -220C degrees conditions.
Re-entry would certainly burn off any survivors.

The evidence of our chemical evolution on Earth is lost.  Scientists are now
searching on other planets/moons/comets/asteroids to look for evidence.

Cell Structure
==============

During the 17th century, telescopes were invented.  Microscopes followed shortly
after by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.  Staining a thin slice of specimen allowed
light to go through and emphasized internal structures.  **Cytologists** are
the people who study cells.

Robert Hooke used a microscope in 1665 to describe what he called **cells** in
a piece of cork.  The cork resembled thousands of tiny sleeping chambers in a
monastery - at that time called cells.  Scientists then discovered that plants
have thick cell walls while animals have a thinner/flexible **plasma membrane**.

Cells were found to live independently as **multicellular** or **unicellular**
organisms as bacteria or protozoa.  These organisms had life-supporting functions
within one or a few cells.

150 years later, **Cell Theory** was explained by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor
Schwann:

1. Cells are the fundamental units of life
2. Cells are the smallest entities that can be called living
3. All organisms are made up of one or more cells

Cells range from over a meter in length (nerve cells called neurons) to tiny
single-celled organisms.  Most tend to be quite small.  Cells are constantly
absorbing/releasing molecules - this is easier to do with a high ratio of surface
area to volume.  If a cell is too large, it cannot maintain a stable internal
environment.  Scientists also believe the nucleus will have a hard time
maintaining larger cells.  Small nucleus means small cell.

Everything within the plasma membrane except the nucleus is **cytoplasm**.  The
**nucleoplasm** holds the contents of the nucleus.  The cell's interior is
made of a complex **solution** and heterogeneous **colloid**.

* Solution is a mixture of two or more components whose particles are so small
  that they cannot be distinguished
* Colloid has particles that are small but large enough not to form a solution

Some areas are in a **sol** state - randomly dispersed throughout the area.
Others are in a **gel** state - collodial particles interact to form a sponge.

The **cell membrane** is the skin of the cell surrounding the cytoplasm and is
about 80 angstroms thick (10 million angstroms per millimeter).  It provides
protection, shape, and strength to the cell.  It also regulates the flow of
material in and out to maintain the cell's **chemical homeostasis** or constant
internal environment.

Movement of materials in/out which requires no energy from the cell is called
**passive transport** as opposed to **active transport**.

**Diffusion** is passive transport where particles move from a dense area to
a less dense area in a seemingly random fashion.  Eventually, particles become
evenly distributed.  **Concentration gradient** is the range of high concentrated
areas to low concentrated areas.

**Osmosis** is passive transport where water flows through a semi-permeable
membrane.  When the membrane separates two solutions of pure water, it's said
to be at equilibrium with equal pressure on both sides.  Each solution is said
to be isosmotic or isotonic.  If one side has a higher concentration, water moves
through the membrane into the medium that is hyperosmotic or hypertonic.  If the
cell is in a medium that is hypoosmotic or hypotonic, water moves into the cell.

The cell membrane includes **carrier molecules** that help move substances in
and out of the cell.

**Facilitated diffusion** is active transport where carrier molecules move
substances in/out that increases the rate of diffusion.

The process that moves particles into the cell is **endocytosis**, moving out
of the cell is **exocytosis**.  When liquids/macromolecules are engulfed by the
membrane and moved to the other side it's called **pinocytosis**.  When it's
larger molecules it's called **phagocytosis**.

All cells have a plasma membrane - some produce a nonliving outer cell wall.
Most plant cell walls are composed of **cellulose**, a complex carbohydrate
composed of long chains of glucose units.  In complex plants, the **primary cell
wall** is the outer layer laid down first by young cells.  Sometimes when cells
contact, another wall is laid down between them known as the central or
**middle lamella** that is composed of **pectin** - another complex carbohydrate.

A **secondary wall** sometimes develop for plant cells that become harder.  It's
in the cytoplasm, inside the primary wall.

**Demosomes** are thin cytoplasmic connections running from one plant cell to
the next through pores (**plasmodesmata**) in the walls.  Demosomes facilitate
exchange of materials like sugars and amino acids.  Animals have a similar
**gap junctions** or **nexus junctions**, areas of low electrical resistance
between cells where electrical impulses/molecules may pass.

The **nucleus** is relatively large, distinct, membrane-enclosed structure that
are found in almost all cells except bacteria and cyanobacteria.  **Vacuoles**
are large, fluid-filled spaces found in many cells - especially plant cells.

The nucleus contains long, thing structures composed of **deoxyribonucleic acid**
(aka **DNA**) and protein known as **chromosomes**.  Chromosomes contain
**genes** which are individual units of information that inform the cell what to
do, how to do it, and when to do it.  All the instructions concerning the life 
processes of the cell come from the genes.

**Nucleic acids** are a group of organic compounds composed of nucleotides which
contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen.  Deoxyribonucleic
acid and **ribonucleic acid (RNA)** are nucleic acids fundamental in storage and
transmission of genetic information, which control the cell's functions.

A dark area within most cells' nucleus is **nucleolus** which contain a high
concentration of RNA and protein.  The nucleus itself is bounded by a **nuclear
membrane** which consists of 2 membranes similar to the cell's membrane.  It's
very selective, many substances can pass through the cell's membrane but not the
nuclear membrane.  Attached to the membrane are membranes of **endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)** which facilitate the flow of materials to/from the nucleus.

ER provides surface area for enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions, particular
those leading to protein synthesis.  They provide a channel between outside of
the cell to the nucleus.  **Ribosomes** are the actual sites of protein synthesis
and are optional to ER (smooth ER is without, rough ER is with).  Ribosomes exist
either free floating in the cytoplasm or along the ER membranes.  The RNA found
in ribosomes are called **ribosomal RNA or rRNA**.  Ribosomes found in clusters
are called **polyribosomes** or **polysomes**.

The **Golgi apparatus or Golgi body** is an organelle where substances like
protein pass through or are stored.  It plays a role in processing protein and
carbohydrates, synthesizing them to more complex molecules.

**Lysosomes** rise from the Golgi body and contain strong digestive enzymes and
act like the cell's digestive system.  It also breaks down older parts of the
cell to form the organic molecules - from which cells were constructed - and
reuse them.

**Mitochondria** supply the cell with chemical energy in the form of the high
energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  They're often the largest
organelle of the cytoplasm.  They're abundant where organisms require large
amounts of energy like muscle cells.  When too much sugar is available, fat
droplets around the mitochondria will produce fat - storing energy for later.

Mitochondria contain DNA, RNA, and ribosomes.  It's thought that they were once
their own living cells but developed a symbiosis relationship with the cells
they're in now.

**Plastids** are mitochondria-like organelles found in photosynthetic plant
cells.  They also contain DNA, RNA, and ribosomes.

**Vacuoles** are membrane-bound spaces in plant/animal cells.  Many poisonous
plants use vacuoles to store toxic chemicals to harm carnivores without harming
itself.

Long protein fibers called **microfilaments** maintain the cell's structure and
movement.  **Microtubules** are larger in diamater and act as tracts for the
cell's organelles to move around.

**Cilia and Flagella** (cillium and flagellum singular) are thin organelles on
the surface of cells that act like fins for movement.  At the end of each are
basal bodies which support them.  Centrioles are similar to basal bodies but
are only found in animal cells.

Cells can be divided into two groups: **eukaryotic cells** and **prokaryotic**.
Eukaryotes are plants/animals said to have eukaryotic cells - cells which have
a distinct nucleus membrane and nucleus.  Prokaryotic cells are more primitive
like bacteria and blue-green algae.  They don't have a nuclear membrane, instead
they have a nuclear area **nucleoid** that contain a single circular chromosome.
