Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
==============================

Bruce A. Tate introduces us to seven different programming languages.  It's
meant to enlighten you with introductions rather than make you an expert.

For each language, Tate will answer:

* What's the typing model?
* What's the programming model?
* How to interact with it?
* What are the decision constructs and core data structures?
* What core features make this language unique?

Ruby
====

Ruby belongs in the family of scripting languages.  It's an interpreted,
dynamically/strong typed, object-oriented language with some functional features.
It's not hugely efficient in terms of execution speed but makes programmers
happier.

Go to [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/] to download Ruby.  Start a REPL
by with the `irb` command (stands for interactive ruby).  Here's a quick sample:

    >> puts 'hello, world'
    hello, world
    >> nil
    >> language = 'my Ruby'
    >> 'my Ruby'
    >> puts "hello, #{language}"
    >> 'hello, my Ruby
    >> nil

Every line returns a value.  Every method you define will always return a value.
If nothing is explicitly returned, the last expression will be implicitly
returned.

Ruby is a pure object oriented language.
