# Overview
HTML5 Up and Running by Mark Pilgrim is an informative guide to select features
from the HTML5 Specification. It's available at @link(http://diveintohtml5.org/)

# History
Every element, attribute, feature of HTML was created by someone who decided how
it should work and wrote it all down.  For example the <img> element:
1. Before there was a W3C, Marc Andreesen emailed his proposal for
   an <img> element with a "src" attribute to a mailing list.
2. People debated on it, came up with alternatives, and various implementations
   of it were done for different browsers.
3. Marc ended up implementing his original proposal in Mosaic.
4. And now we have an <img> element that became an HTML standard.

It's really as simple as this: we have an <img> element because Marc Andreesen
shipped on in his browser, and shipping code wins.

HTML has been constantly evolving.  It's always been developed between browser
makers, authors, standards "wonks", and other people who just wanted to get
involved.

In 1997, the W3C published the HTML 4.0 specification.  They then published the
XML 1.0 specification and decided to reformulate HTML into XML instead of 
trying to extend HTML.  That gave birth to XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1.

XHTML has "draconian error handling".  If served with the correct MIME type,
{{ application/xhtml+xml }} browsers would complete break pages when there were
any minor errors.  So most people ended up using the {{ text/html }} MIME type,
which was a loophole.  It allowed authors to use an XHTML syntax but keep
serving it in a forgiving environment.

In 2004, the W3C branched off the What Working Group.  What WG wanted to work on
an evolution of the existing HTML 4 standard to include features for modern
web aplication developers:
* backward compatibility based on existing tech: HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript
* well defined error handling (as opposed to the draconian error handling or 
  inconsistent error handling implementations between browsers)
* users should not be exposed to author errors
* practical useful features
* embrace scripting
* avoidance of device specific profiling
* web forms

WHAT Working Group = {{ Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group }}
They called their specification {{ Web Applications 1.0 }}

For years the W3C and What WG ignored each other, working on XHTML 2.0 and
Web Applications 1.0 respectively.  By 2006, Web Applications 1.0 was 
picking up more momentum while XHTML 2 remained mostly unimplemented by
browsers.  In October 2006, Tim Berners Lee announched that the What WG
and W3C would begin working together.  

Web Applications 1.0 was renamed to {{ HTML5 }}.  In October 2009, The W3C shut
down the XHTML2 Working Group.

# Feature Detection
You can start using HTML5 now, it's a collection of individual features.
You can do this using feature detection.  If the current browser has a
certain feature - use it, otherwise fallback.

Detection techniques fall in four categories:
1. Check for property on global object (ie. window or navigator)
2. Create an element, then check if that element has a certain property
3. Create an element, check if a method exists, call that method, and check
   the return value
4. Create an element, set a property and check if the value is retained

Modenizr @link(http://www.modernizr.com/) is an HTML5 detection library.

# Updated and New Elements
## Doctype, Html, and Head
The new {{ doctype }} for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html>

The root element just needs a {{ lang }} attribute set: <html lang="en">

Inside the {{ head }} element, you'll need to specify the content type and
character encoding of your document.  You may also specify any stylesheets,
alternate formats, and general meta data.  Example:
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />  
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles.css" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="/feed.xml" />
  </head>

Many of the mandatory HTML4 attributes were dropped in favor of defaults.  IE,
you no longer have to specify the type="text/css" for stylesheets.

## New Semantic Elements
From the specification: 
@link(http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html)

New elements include:
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <section> | Represents a generic section of a document, provides thematic   |
|           | grouping, typically with a header.                              |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <nav>     | Represents a section that links to other pages or parts.        |
|           | Only major navigations are appropriate for <nav>, for example a |
|           | footer with many links is not appropriate.                      |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <article> | A self-contained composition in a document, which can be        |
|           | independently distributed.  Eg: newspaper article, blog entry,  |
|           | user comment, or interactive widget                             |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <aside>   | Sections which are only tagnentially related to the main        |
|           | content of the page.  Eg: sidebars, ads, or featured quotes.    |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <hgroup>  | The heading of a section which groups h1-h6 elements when       |
|           | headings have multiple levels.  Eg: subheading or taglines.     |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <header>  | Introductory or navigational aids.  Usually contains h1-h6 and  |
|           | hgroup elements.  May also contain table of contents, search    |
|           | form, or relevant logos.                                        |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <footer>  | Typically contains information about its ancestor such as the   |
|           | author, links to related documents, or copyright.               |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <time>    | Either a time on a 24-hour clock or precise date.               |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| <mark>    | Run of text in one document highlighted for reference.          |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

Not all browsers support these elements yet.  Two important questions to ask
when a browser finds an {{ unknown element }}:
- How should this element be styled?
- What should the element's DOM look like?

For non-IE browsers, you can style unknown elements:
  article { border: 1px solid red; } /* Won't be applied in IE < 9 */

Unfortunately, if IE doesn't recognize the element name, it will insert the
element into the DOM as an empty node with no children.  Any actual children
will become siblings.

To solve both problems in IE, just create a dummy element of the same type
before you use it in the page:
  <head>
    <!-- Now articles will be recognized! -->
    <script>document.createElement("article");</script>
  </head>

Here is the HTML5 enabling script for IE by Remy Sharp:
  @link(http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js)
  <!--[if lt IE 9]> <script>
    var e = ("abbr,article,aside,audio,canvas,datalist,details," + 
             "figure,footer,header,hgroup,mark,menu,meter,nav,output," + 
             "progress,section,time,video").split(',');
    for (var i = 0; i < e.length; i++) {
      document.createElement(e[i]);
    } 
  </script> <![endif]-->
