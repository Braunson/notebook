Simple Guide to a Minimalist Life
=================================

By Leo Babauta of [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.com) fame.

Definition of Minimalist and Guiding Principles
===============================================

A minimalist life is stripped of unnecessary to make room for whatever gives
you joy.  It eschews the mindset of more and embraces less.  It values quality
over quantity.

The goal is to adopt these qualities:

* have more freedom, time, and room for what's important/joyful
* have less worry
* be more frugal, green, and healthier

By following these principles:

1. Omit needless things
2. Identify the essential (what makes you happy, what do you consider important)
3. Make everything count
4. Fill your life with joy (don't just leave it empty)
5. Constantly edit

At a more tactical level:

1. Realize you already have enough
2. Cut back on clutter and possessions
3. Start simplifying your schedule and cut back on commitments
4. Slowly edit everything you do with minimalist principles in mind

Contentedness is an important part of minimalism.  You must realize you already
have enough.  Stop buying non-necessities.  Be happy by doing instead of
owning.  Some examples of things you can give up: car, meat, lots of clothes,
big homes, anything luxurious.

Minimalist Commitments, Home, and Workspace
===========================================

Reduce commitments!  List out all commitments and pick only the important ones,
slowly drop the rest.  Learn to say "No" to new commitments that aren't important
or don't excite you.  Clear your schedule and cut back on the to-do list.

Clutter weighs you down, stresses you out, and is a pain to maintain.  Start by
getting rid of things you haven't used in 6 months.  Don't develop a habit of
buying or getting new things unless it's a necessity.  Go through your home one
room at a time and start de-cluttering.  Do the same with your workspace.
Consider going paperless and digitizing documents.

Minimalist Travels, Wardrobe, Food, Fitness, and Finances
=========================================================

Pack lightly and keep your itinerary loose when traveling.  Here's an example
packing list:

* travel docs (password, credit card, ID)
* toiletries (deodorant, toothbrush)
* one or two shorts/jeans
* one or two t-shirts (quick dry works best here)
* two quick dry boxers
* swim trunks or hoodie
* camera
* all packed into a small backpack

Don't overplan your trip.  Instead, leave plenty of room for unplanned
activities.  Plan a few must-dos and leave the rest to chance.

Eating less solves a lot of health problems.  Just make sure you get more
nutrients from the meals you do eat.  Some tips:

* eat until you're almost full
* eat smaller, lighter meals
* think fiber or water-rich foods
* fast for 18-24 hours a few times a week
* consume food in as closest to its natural state as possible
* think fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and lean proteins

Minimalist fitness focuses on working out less with less equipment.  Consider
doing a few 20 minute jogging sessions.  The key is to get active and form
a habit.  There are also a number of exercises you can do without equipment or
with very minimal equipment: push ups, pull ups, dumbbells, kettlebell, jump
rope, etc...

Simplify your financial life by:

1. Ending consumerism
2. Save up an emergency fund
3. Get out of debt
4. Use cash instead of credit
5. Automate finances (like bill pay and savings)
6. Don't buy it unless you need it and have the money

Dealing With Others
===================

Some tips:

1. Focus on yourself and the areas you have control over first
2. Lead by example, show how happy it makes you
3. Educate on how minimalism helps
4. Ask for help
5. Set boundaries, don't overstep other people's lives
6. Find compromises
7. Find acceptance
